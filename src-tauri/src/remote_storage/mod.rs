//! holzi's own S3 (spec 038, plan.md "Structure Decision"): storage connections (provider,
//! endpoint, region, addressing; the credentials are an entry of the password manager owned by
//! `storage`, rule Z14 of spec 034) and the storages on them, one bucket each. holzi speaks the
//! protocol itself; extensions are one consumer of it (PR D), spec 029 another.
//!
//! [`RemoteStore`] is the one seam to the provider: [`s3::S3Store`] signs with `rusty-s3` and sends
//! with `reqwest` to the address [`address`] checked and pinned (research R1, R8); tests use a fake
//! (research R10). No error of this module carries an endpoint, a header or a body of the provider.
