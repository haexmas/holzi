//! Which endpoints holzi talks to (spec 038 FR-017, FR-009b, research R8).
//!
//! [`check_endpoint`] looks at the address as typed: only `http` and `https`, no user name or
//! password in it, and no IP address that is never reached. [`scope_of`] fixes the scope of an
//! endpoint when it is set ([`EndpointScope`]): `local` when its host resolves to loopback or
//! private addresses only, `public` when it resolves to public addresses only. [`pin`] runs before
//! every call: it resolves the host once, checks that every address lies in the stored scope, and
//! hands back the addresses the request must go to, so a name that points elsewhere a moment later
//! (DNS rebinding) reaches nothing new.
//!
//! - Never: link-local (`169.254.0.0/16` with the metadata service of a cloud, `fe80::/10`),
//!   unspecified, multicast and broadcast addresses, also as IPv4-mapped IPv6.
//! - Loopback and private addresses (RFC 1918, RFC 4193) only for scope `local`, public addresses
//!   only for scope `public`; a host with both is refused.
//! - `http` only for scope `local`.
