//! SQL of migration `0027_passwords_owner` (spec 038, data-model.md, research R2): the column `owner`
//! of a password entry. `NULL` is an entry of the user; otherwise it names the holzi function the
//! entry belongs to (`storage` for the credentials of a storage connection), and rule Z14 of spec 034
//! hides the entry from every caller but the user and that function. The table is CRDT-tracked, so
//! [`super::migrations::HOLZI_TRIGGER_VERSION`] is raised with it.
