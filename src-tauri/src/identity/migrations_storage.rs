//! SQL of migration `0028_storage_connections` (spec 038, data-model.md, research R3): the storage
//! connections of holzi (provider, endpoint, region, addressing; the credentials are an entry of the
//! password manager owned by `storage`), the storages on them (one bucket each, the target of the
//! extension permission `remoteStorage`) and the last test result per storage on this device.
//!
//! Connections and storages are vault-wide and sync (spec 038 FR-006); the test result is an
//! observation of one device, so it stays here. Synced tables carry no UNIQUE constraint (a conflict
//! would halt the sync, as in [`super::migrations_extensions`]); the field rules are checked in
//! `remote_storage::store`. New CRDT tables raise [`super::migrations::HOLZI_TRIGGER_VERSION`].

/// The migration `0028_storage_connections`; registered in
