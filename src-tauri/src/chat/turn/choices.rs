//! Asking the user from the tool round (spec 046, research R1/R4). After a round's calls ran, every
//! result that carries a [`ChoiceRequest`] is put to the user, one after the other, and replaced by
//! the outcome: an action runs again with the answer in its field (no second approval, FR-012; it
//! may ask again), `ask_user` gets the answer as its result, a declined question ends as
//! `declined_by_user`. Runs before the round's cancel check, so a turn cancelled while a question is
//! open still leaves no rows.
