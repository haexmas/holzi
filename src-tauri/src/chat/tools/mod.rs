//! Tool trait, registry, and the Manual/Auto/Plan approval gate.
//!
//! A [`Tool`] is anything the turn loop (`chat/commands.rs`) can hand to an
//! adapter as a [`crate::adapters::types::ToolSpec`] and later execute once
//! the model asks for it. The registry holds every tool from every source
//! (host-CLI, MCP) behind one `Arc<dyn Tool>` so the loop never branches on
//! where a tool came from (host-CLI, MCP, or an action of the app, spec 032).
