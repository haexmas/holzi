//! Finding out in the background whether a local model can call tools (spec 032 FR-018a/b,
//! scenario 7). A model nobody knows anything about is asked once, after it loaded: first the
//! chat template (does it take tools at all?), then the five example sentences marked for the
//! self-test. The answer goes into the model's record, and from then on the chat treats the model
//! as it is. The chat is never blocked: a message the person sends, another model, or the end of
//! the vault ends the check, and a model asked too little is asked again at its next load.
