//! File attachments a user adds to the message being composed (spec
//! 011-composer-toolbar-parity). Classification is by file extension and
//! byte size only — never by parsing file contents, so a corrupt or
//! disguised file fails at the provider's own decode step, not here.
//!
//! Two separate concerns, kept apart because they answer different
//! questions (data-model.md "Message Attachment"): [`classify_attachment`]
//! ("is this file even attachable at all" — FR-016, independent of any
//! backend) and [`usability_for`] ("can the *currently selected*
//! model/backend use it" — FR-015, independent of the file itself).
