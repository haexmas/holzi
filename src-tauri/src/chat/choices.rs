//! Questions the tool round puts to the user (spec 046, contracts/choice-contract.md): an action
//! that could not resolve an input, or the agent's `ask_user`. The round parks on a oneshot per
//! question and emits `chat-choice-request`; the chat answers through `respond_choice`. The same
//! lifecycle as the tool approvals (`pending_tool_approvals`): no timeout, a cancelled turn drops
//! every open question, and a late answer to one of those is harmless.
