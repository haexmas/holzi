//! Who may do what with files (spec 044 FR-031–FR-033, FR-037, research R14), pure and testable
//! without a database, like `passwords/access.rs`.
//!
//! - The user reaches the device and every storage; holzi's own places only read-only.
//! - Agents (built-in, and external ones of spec 021) never reach holzi's own places, before any
//!   grant is asked. The device needs the grant "files of the device": the built-in agent has it
//!   unless revoked, an external agent only once granted. A storage needs a grant for exactly that
//!   storage; without one the caller asks the user, `read` never writes, `denied` refuses.
//! - Extensions and holzi functions use their own entrances (`extensions::fs`, `remote_storage`).
//!
//! Paths are checked as resolved targets ([`crate::files::local::resolve`]), never as spelled.
