//! Tauri-managed application state: single-slot active instance.
//!
//! Contract: `tauri-commands.md` — only one active instance per app process (FR-022, now enforced
//! by refusal rather than a switch: spec 013 FR-010, ADR 0003). `install` is the one place that
//! publishes a handle, under the same lock as the gate's own `Idle` → `Active` transition, so the
//! two never disagree.
//!
//! The slot is private to this module (spec 013): requests reach the vault through
//! [`AppState::database`], which hands out a [`VaultDb`] that the gate's tracker counts, and the
//! lifecycle commands publish and remove the handle through the methods below.
