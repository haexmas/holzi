//! Tells the frontend which tables of the open vault changed, whatever changed them.
//!
//! haex-crdt reports the tables of every committed transaction: a local write from any window,
//! an agent or an extension, a batch received from another device, a resync. This module turns
//! those reports into the one [`VAULT_DATA_CHANGED`] event, so a view that shows vault data
//! needs no knowledge of where a change came from (spec 024 FR-032, extended to every writer).
//!
//! Reports are collected for [`WINDOW`] and sent as one event with the union of their tables, so
//! a burst of commits (a streaming chat reply, a received page of thousands of rows) wakes the
//! frontend once.
