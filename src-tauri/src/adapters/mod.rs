//! Provider adapters — one implementation per provider kind.
//!
//! The `ProviderAdapter` trait is what the refresh and chat paths call
//! against. Both `list_models` (Etappe-2 refresh path) and `stream_chat`
//! (Etappe-3 chat dispatch) go through the trait, so `ChatState` sees a
//! single `Arc<dyn ProviderAdapter>` regardless of whether the model
//! runs in-process (`LocalAdapter`) or over HTTP (`AnthropicAdapter`).
//! Additional `api_key` vendors (OpenAI, Google, Groq) land as their own
//! follow-up PRs using the same trait surface. `cli_delegate` adapters
//! (Claude Code, Codex — spec 007-cli-delegate) live in [`cli_delegate`];
//! they drive an external CLI subprocess to completion per `stream_chat`
//! call instead of a direct HTTP/in-process request, but otherwise
//! implement the same trait.
