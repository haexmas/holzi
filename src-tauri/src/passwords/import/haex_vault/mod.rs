//! Import from haex-vault (spec 037): haex-vault has no export, so its vault file is read directly.
//! The password manager of holzi took its data model from haex-vault (spec 034), so the mapping is
//! nearly one to one (`specs/037-haex-vault-import/contracts/haex-vault-mapping.md`). Unlike the
//! other parsers this one needs the file on disk, not its bytes: it opens a copy with the vault
//! password ([`open`]), checks the layout and reads the rows ([`read`]).
