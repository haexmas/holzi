//! Which holzi functions use an entry (spec 034, FR-034, `contracts/access.md`): a function such as
//! the own S3 storage (spec 029) registers a provider at its start, and the window asks before an
//! entry is deleted, so the user is warned that a function depends on it (the delete is still
//! allowed). The password manager recognizes this by nothing but what the functions report: not by
//! tags and not by names. No provider is registered in this spec; spec 029 registers the first.
