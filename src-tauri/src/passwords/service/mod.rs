//! `PasswordsService`: the single entrance to the data of the password manager (spec 034,
//! `contracts/access.md` §Dienst, FR-024). The window, the built-in agent, extensions, external
//! agents and holzi functions all come through here, each as a [`Caller`]; no code reads or writes
//! the `haex_passwords_*` tables around it, and the Tauri commands call nothing else.
//!
//! Every method takes the caller first and checks it before it touches data. The caller is the
//! entrance, never an argument of a command: a command fixes it (`Caller::User` for the window,
//! `Caller::BuiltinAgent` for the chat action), a holzi function passes `Caller::Internal` with a
//! grant fixed in its code. Each area adds its methods in its own file (`items`, `organize`,
//! `trash`, `history`, `attachments`, `passkeys`, `presets`, `import`, `usage`).
//!
//! The rules themselves are the pure functions of [`super::access`]; a method calls the one it needs
//! and passes the `Denied` through `?`, which maps it to `PasswordsForbidden` or
//! `PasswordsNotFound`. Everything beyond the five item methods is for the user alone ([`require_user`],
//! rule Z11).
