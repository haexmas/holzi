//! Attachment commands (spec 034, US5, `contracts/tauri-commands.md` §Anhänge). Files travel as
//! the choice of the system's dialogs (spec 043: a path or a provider address), never as bytes
//! through the webview; only the bytes of an image
//! preview go back, as raw bytes (`tauri::ipc::Response`).
