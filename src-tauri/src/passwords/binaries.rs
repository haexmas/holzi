//! Attachments and the binary data behind them (spec 034, US5, FR-019..FR-022, research R4).
//!
//! The data lies as a BLOB in `haex_passwords_binaries`, unique by the SHA-256 of the raw bytes;
//! an entry (or a history state) links it under a file name. The size limit (25 MiB) is checked on
//! the file's metadata **before** the file is read where a size is known, the file name is stored as text (never a path),
//! and the data is read only by its own query, never in a list.
//!
//! Clean-up: when the last link to a binary goes, it is marked (`orphaned_at`) and removed only
//! after seven days, so a link of another device that has not arrived yet does not run into
//! nothing. A custom icon (`type = 'icon'`) has no link row; it counts as used while some entry,
//! folder, passkey or history state names `binary:<hash>`.
