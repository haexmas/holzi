//! The host for haextensions (spec 017, ADR-0004, ADR-0008): signed web bundles that run in
//! sandboxed frames and reach holzi only through one checkpoint in Rust.
//!
//! This module grows with the deliveries of the spec (research R1). The foundation holds the
//! identifiers, the error codes of the bridge and the pure permission model.
