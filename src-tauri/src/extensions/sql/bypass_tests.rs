//! The bypass corpus of extension SQL (spec 017, SC-002, T052, contracts/sql-policy.md
//! §Umgehungssammlung), run three ways: pre-check alone, authorizer alone (pre-check skipped by
//! `exec::prepare_unchecked`), both. Every forbidden form must fail each way; every allowed form
//! must pass each way.
//!
//! Starting set ported from haex-space/haex-vault `8dce379d94e18fcd42c3b73686a06f984ca3f574`,
//! `src-tauri/src/extension/database/tests/sql_injection_tests/` (comment_smuggling,
//! dangerous_statements, edge_cases, multi_statement, extraction, table_prefix, union_select) with
//! holzi's tables in place of haex-vault's (`haex_extensions` → `chat_threads` and `haex_*`).
//! These run here as unit tests because they need the crate's test vault and the pre-check skip.

// The corpus reads what was stored to show nothing changed.
