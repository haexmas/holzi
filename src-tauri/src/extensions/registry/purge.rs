//! Clearing up on this device after an extension was removed (spec 017, T079, research R11).
//!
//! The removing device sets `purge_hlc` (and `purge_data` for "delete data") on the extension's
//! row. Every device, the removing one included, clears up once per new `purge_hlc` in one local
//! write: always this device's key-value rows and the logs; with `purge_data` also the prefixed
//! tables, the migration journal and the parked sync groups older than the removal. Newer groups
//! were parked by the sync receiver while this clear-up was due and apply after the migrations of
//! a reinstall. The trigger is `purge_hlc`, not `state`: a device that was offline while the
//! extension was removed and installed again only sees `state = installed`, yet must clear up.
//! Changes older than `purge_hlc` that arrive later are dropped by the sync receiver
//! (`sync::inbound::park`).
