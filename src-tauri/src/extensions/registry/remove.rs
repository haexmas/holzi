//! Removing an extension from the vault (spec 017, FR-008, research R11). The removing device
//! keeps the `extensions` row as a tombstone with `state = removed`, `purge_data` and `purge_hlc`
//! (the HLC of this very write), and deletes the other registry rows the normal way, so the
//! deletions sync. The clear-up of tables and device-local state runs on every device, this one
//! included, once it sees the new `purge_hlc` ([`super::purge`], [`super::lifecycle`]).
//!
//! With "keep data" the migrations stay vault data, so every device, also one added later, can
//! still create the extension's tables and take over synced rows for them (FR-008, FR-037).
//! [`purge_kept_data`] deletes such kept data later, as a removal with "delete data" would have.
//!
//! BLOBs no file refers to any more get `orphaned_at`; they are collected after seven days
//! (data-model.md, [`super::blobs`]), so a reinstall in between needs no new transfer.
