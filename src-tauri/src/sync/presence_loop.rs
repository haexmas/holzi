//! The presence loop of an open vault (spec 024, FR-007, FR-008, FR-010,
//! FR-044, FR-045, contracts/nostr-events.md).
//!
//! [`run`] connects to the Nostr relays, listens on today's and yesterday's
//! mailbox and sends what this device has to say there:
//!
//! - a listed device with at least one peer sends its presence (kind 24100);
//! - a device the list does not name yet, a copy of a linked device's vault
//!   file, sends a signed request to be admitted (kind 24101,
//!   [`crate::sync::admission`]) until a main device admits it;
//! - a removed device, and a device whose list names only itself, send
//!   nothing.
//!
//! What arrives is checked before anything else happens: a presence meeting
//! from a listed device is recorded and dialed; one from an unknown device
//! that claims a newer device list is dialed once, to fetch that list (a copy
//! of a main device enrolled itself, FR-007); a request from an unknown
//! device is kept for the main devices to decide on.
