//! Brings the sync of the open vault up to date when holzi comes back to the foreground or the
//! network changes (spec 043, FR-018, FR-019, research R5).
//!
//! Android stops a backgrounded app's sockets without telling it, and iroh does not see Android's
//! network changes from native code (`Endpoint::network_change` says so). Nothing here syncs in the
//! background (FR-018): a [`Wake`] only shortcuts what the session would otherwise do on its next
//! tick, so a change made elsewhere arrives within seconds instead of a minute (SC-005). Both wakes
//! rebuild the Nostr relay connections, which also republishes this device's presence, and run the
//! reconnect pass of [`crate::sync::reconnect_missing`]; a network change also tells iroh.
