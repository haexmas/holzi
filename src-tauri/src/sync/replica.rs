//! This device's copy of the vault as the sync sees it (spec 024).
//!
//! The sender reads its progress and then scans table by table; haex-crdt
//! locks its connection per call, not across the scan. Two things keep a
//! pull gap-free all the same:
//!
//! - Changes the sync applies from other devices take the exchange lock,
//!   together with the progress they advance, and so does serving a pull.
//!   A scan therefore never sees a foreign change without the progress
//!   that covers the changes before it.
//! - Own writes do not take the lock. The sender only serves changes up to
//!   the progress it read first ([`crate::sync::outbound`]), so an own
//!   write that lands during the scan waits for the next pull.
