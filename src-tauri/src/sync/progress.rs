//! Progress per origin device (spec 024, FR-019, research R4).
//!
//! Every cell carries the node id of the device that wrote it in its HLC;
//! that node id is the writer's `vault_device_uuid`, the origin. A device's
//! progress for an origin is the highest HLC up to which it has applied, or
//! rejected under research R5, every change of that origin. Progress only
//! grows, and only after the changes it covers are committed, so every
//! device holds a gap-free prefix of each origin's history and the next
//! pull, from whichever device, starts right after it.
//!
//! For itself a device is complete up to the newest cell it wrote into a
//! synced table ([`crate::sync::replica::Replica::progress`]). That is not
//! haex-crdt's persisted HLC: every write transaction advances that one,
//! also one that only touched device-local tables, and advertising it would
//! make the devices pull from each other without end. A stored row for the
//! own origin only exists when a peer delivered own changes this file did
//! not have, as after restoring an older copy.
