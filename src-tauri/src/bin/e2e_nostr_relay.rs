//! A Nostr relay for the end-to-end tests (spec 024, T078): the same
//! in-process relay the integration tests use (`MockRelay`), run as a process
//! so two application processes can find each other through it without a
//! network. Prints its address (`ws://127.0.0.1:<port>`) as the only line on
//! stdout and runs until it is killed. Built only with `--features e2e`.
//!
//! The port is chosen by the system unless `HOLZI_E2E_RELAY_PORT` names one
//! (spec 033, R3): a harness that picks the port itself can stop the relay and
//! start it again on the same address. The relay keeps nothing across starts.
