//! The vault passphrase, held so that it is erased when dropped and never printed.
//!
//! The passphrase is passed verbatim as the SQLCipher key, so it is the most sensitive value in
//! the app (spec 013, FR-013 to FR-016). This type is the only way argument structs carry it: it
//! erases its buffer on drop, has no `Clone` so no copy is made by accident, and prints as
//! `<redacted>` in every `Debug` output, so it cannot reach a log line through a derived `Debug`.
//! Copies that the frontend runtime, the IPC layer and SQLCipher itself hold are outside what this
//! type can wipe; the process ending on close is the guarantee for those.
