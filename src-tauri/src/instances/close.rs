//! `close_instance`: closing the vault ends the app process, and nothing can refuse it
//! (spec 013 US1, FR-001 to FR-009, contracts/tauri-commands.md).
//!
//! **Phase 1** ([`begin_close`]) is synchronous and cannot fail: the gate shuts, the cancellation
//! token fires, the turn and the preload are cancelled, the page is replaced by the closing
//! spinner and the list-changed event goes out. The command returns as soon as it is done.
//! **Phase 2** ([`finish_close`]) runs in the background: it lets go of the session, drains the
//! tracked work within the ladder's limits, drops the database, and asks for the end of the
//! process. Two deadlines back it up, both ending the process from a plain thread: one armed with
//! phase 1, for a phase 2 that never gets to run, and one armed right after the end request, for
//! an event loop that does not end the process (SC-002).
