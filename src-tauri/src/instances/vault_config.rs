//! The single `DatabaseConfig` every vault open goes through.
//!
//! `create_instance` and `open_instance` differ only in
//! `create_if_missing`; everything else — migration set, bootstrap,
//! signature provider and above all the CRDT trigger version — must be
//! identical, or the two paths provision subtly different vaults. Having
//! two hand-written copies is how `trigger_version` drifts, so there is
//! exactly one copy here.
