//! `open_instance` — unlock an existing vault as the process's one active instance.
//!
//! Contract: `tauri-commands.md` §`open_instance`. One app process serves at most one vault
//! session (spec 013 FR-010, ADR 0003): opening or creating while one is already active or a
//! close is under way is refused, checked before any path is resolved. WrongPassphrase and
//! NotFound both surface as generic "open failed" on the frontend (FR-021); the typed
//! discriminator is for logs and telemetry only.
