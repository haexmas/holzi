## Notes

- One clarification marker is open, in FR-008: which providers v1 must support
  and test. Entwurf §12 (Kandidaten aus der Entwurfssitzung, ungeprüft) lists
  Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, MinIO and AWS S3, plus Hetzner as unverified (superseded: v1 = RustFS and AWS S3).
  Whether each offers bucket-scoped tokens, bucket versioning, a retention rule
  for old versions, and a read-write token that cannot delete old versions
  (FR-004 c to g, g = revoked token rejected within 5 minutes) is unverified. That
  decides whether a provider lands on "geeignet" or "ungeeignet" (FR-005,
  two outcomes only since D25). Resolve with `/speckit-clarify`, ideally after a short
  provider check.
- "No implementation details": S3, buckets and versioning are named because
  they are the feature itself (operator instruction).
  Wire formats, the provider admin APIs and the envelope format stay plan
  material.
- Decision taken without a marker: moving a space between backend A and B is in
  scope as P3 (User Story 8), justified in the Clarifications. Cost/quota display
  is an optional KANN requirement (FR-036).
- Decisions taken as assumptions rather than markers: default retention of old
  versions is 30 days (FR-011); tokens exist per capability type, not per member, as in
  the design; members with the delete capability get the read-write token
  because S3 does not separate writing from deleting.
- FR-017 and FR-033 treat the admin's full provider credentials and unwrapped
  access tokens as Nur-direkt-Daten (spec 024): they travel only over direct
  connections between devices of the same vault, never through any relay mailbox, not
  even the vault's own. Each device unwraps the token envelopes itself; the
  envelopes may travel through mailboxes.
- Cross-spec alignment (2026-09-28): the space mailbox stays on the admin's
  relay independent of backend B, and without a relay it syncs only directly;
  there is no default backend, the choice at space creation is mandatory (spec
  027 FR-003); settings live in „Föderation“ (space detail view under „Spaces“,
  own folders under „Ordner“); where saved storage connections are managed is
  left to the plan. New FR-040: an admin device removes unreferenced objects
  from backend B with the admin credentials.
- FR-015 refines the design's "inside the encrypted space data": the tokens
  travel with the space data but in per-recipient envelopes, so a read-only
  member cannot decrypt the read-write token.
- SC-002 (old token rejected within 5 minutes) depends on the provider's own
  revocation latency; the suitability check measures it with a test key
  (FR-004 g), so SC-002 holds for every provider marked „geeignet“. Review fix
  2026-09-28: FR-018 revokes at the provider before the new member list is
  published, FR-022 publishes anyway on failure and retries with a persistent
  warning.
- Aligned with the sibling spec 027 as written: 027 excludes dissolving a space
  and switching a space's backend. This spec lifts the switching exclusion (User
  Story 8, also from "nur direkte Übertragung" to B) and keeps dissolving out of
  scope. User Story 7 therefore covers giving up a bucket (after a move, or when
  the vault's own folders stop using it) and removing a storage connection;
  FR-034 also applies once a later spec introduces dissolving a space.

- 2026-09-28: the operator answered all clarification questions for this spec; the markers are
  resolved in the spec and recorded under Clarifications. Notes above that describe open markers are
  historical.
- D25 (2026-09-28): providers that fail any criterion of FR-004 cannot be
  connected for a space; the former fallback path via an admin device and
  short-lived provider-signed access is removed. The suitability check has two
  outcomes (FR-005). Members use their scoped token directly (FR-023), admin
  devices use the admin credentials (FR-024), garbage collection runs on an
  admin device (FR-040). User Story 5, FR-023 to FR-025 and SC-008 were
  rewritten for this.
