# Specification Quality Checklist: CLI Delegate Backend (Claude Code / Codex)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The one [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker (FR-006 / User Story 3) was resolved in the 2026-09-16
  clarification session, then the resolution itself was superseded later the same session once live
  verification against an installed `claude` CLI showed Claude Code's `-p` mode does support a live,
  blocking, per-tool-call approval round-trip via `--permission-prompt-tool` (see spec.md
  "Clarifications" for both the original answer and the addendum that replaced it). Final state: both
  delegate backends get live per-tool-use approval through holzi's existing permission gate, no
  backend-specific batch-approval exception.
- Named CLI flags, protocols, and process names (e.g. `claude -p`, `codex app-server --stdio`,
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) appear only in Input/Assumptions/Out-of-scope framing, not inside functional
  requirements or success criteria — kept there deliberately since they are pre-existing, agreed
  design decisions this spec inherits rather than re-derives, not requirements phrased in
  implementation terms.
