# Contract: Tauri Commands (Rust ↔ Frontend)

**Status**: Working draft against [`haexmas/haex-crdt` at
`1c069ef0ea19143af2748f40fc41cba05c94dbe1` (`Cargo.toml`, package
0.4.0)](https://github.com/haexmas/haex-crdt/blob/1c069ef0ea19143af2748f40fc41cba05c94dbe1/Cargo.toml).
The pinned revision removes the crate's device-ID arbitration and exposes the
[`DatabaseBootstrap` hook](https://github.com/haexmas/haex-crdt/blob/1c069ef0ea19143af2748f40fc41cba05c94dbe1/src/device_id.rs)
holzi runs its per-installation known-devices lookup in. Field names and shapes
are stable enough to implement against; the error-mapping table below reflects
the pinned crate surface. Any change to the pin's migration IDs,
`DatabaseBootstrap` signature, bootstrap ordering, or `Database::open` shape
reopens this contract.

**V1 contract note**: Genesis creates a fresh vault, generating a per-vault
identity keypair (see [Vault identity and device model](#vault-identity-and-device-model)).
Backup restore is a plain `open_instance` of a copied `.db` — no rekey, no
attestation, no restore-pairing handshake. The copy carries the vault
identity and the source's `known_devices` rows; the `DatabaseBootstrap` hook
reuses the row matching this installation's UUID when present, or adds a
new row with a fresh vault-scoped device UUID when the copy came from
another installation.

**Convention**: All commands are async, return `Result<T, HolziError>` on the Rust side, and are exposed to the frontend via `@tauri-apps/api/core::invoke<T>(name, args)`. Argument keys are `camelCase` from the frontend, mapped to `snake_case` Rust field names by serde.

## Data layer and providers

`haex-crdt` exposes a `Database` handle and requires three provider
implementations from holzi plus a `trigger_version` configuration value. These
providers, the holzi-owned migrations, and the error-mapping layer are the
seams between holzi and the crate. This section documents them normatively;
command sections reference these seams without re-explaining them.

### Vault identity and device model

**Three layered identities**, each with a distinct scope:

- **Vault identity** — one keypair per vault, generated at Genesis and stored
  in the vault DB (`vault_identity` singleton). Copied along with the `.db`,
  so every replica of the same vault holds the same vault identity by
  definition. Used to authenticate an install to other replicas of the same
  vault via proof-of-possession on connection setup: the initiator signs a
  per-connection challenge, the receiver verifies against the vault public
  key it also holds. No shared secret over the wire, no persisted attestation.
- **Installation UUID** — one random UUID per holzi installation on a host,
  stored in a single file **outside** any vault, at `<AppLocalData>/installation-id`.
  Shared by every vault opened by that installation. The file itself never
  leaves the device — it is not a payload holzi ships anywhere, and no
  network path reads it. The value is written into every vault the
  installation opens (as the `installation_uuid` column of a row in
  `known_devices`) so that a copied `.db` reopened by the same installation
  can find its existing row. Because the column is a normal CRDT-tracked
  field, the value does travel through the sync channel to other replicas
  of the same vault; the two-vaults-on-one-host case is discussed with
  `known_devices` below.
- **Vault-device UUID** — one per (vault × installation), stored as a row in
  the vault's `known_devices` table. `installation_uuid` is the lookup key
  the bootstrap hook uses to find "this replica's own row" and is that row's
  immutable primary key;
  `vault_device_uuid`, alias, timestamps, and endpoint metadata form the
  rest of the (fully synced) row. The primary-key value is carried in the
  CRDT change's `row_pks` identity object; it is not a mutable column change.
  This UUID is the HLC node id for this
  replica of this vault. Two vaults opened by the same installation get
  independent random vault-device UUIDs; two installations opening the same
  vault (via a copied `.db`) get independent random vault-device UUIDs.

The lookup on every open is: read the local installation UUID from
`<AppLocalData>/installation-id` → find the matching
`known_devices.installation_uuid` row in the vault → use that row's
vault-device UUID as HLC node id. A copied database from the same
installation therefore reuses its row; a copy from another installation
has no matching row for its installation and receives a fresh one from
the bootstrap hook. The immutable `installation_uuid` row identity is
carried in each change's `row_pks`; the row's non-PK fields are emitted as
ordinary CRDT column changes, so the row a bootstrap hook inserts
eventually surfaces on other replicas of the same vault.

### Provider implementations

Three consumer seams implemented by holzi in a dedicated `src-tauri/identity/`
module. Extraction into a standalone `haex-identity` crate is deferred until
the surface has stabilized against a working slice.

- **`DatabaseBootstrap`** — the bootstrap hook `haex-crdt` 0.4.0 calls after
  migrations and before HLC init, inside an unsigned transaction the crate
  commits on `Ok` or rolls back on `Err`. Holzi's implementation:

  1. Reads the installation UUID from `<AppLocalData>/installation-id`,
     minting and fsyncing the file if it does not yet exist.
  2. Looks up the row on `known_devices.installation_uuid`.
  3. Reuses the matching `vault_device_uuid` if present; otherwise mints a
     fresh one and inserts a complete consumer-owned `known_devices` row.
     It MUST NOT write the three `_no_sync`-suffixed metadata columns
     (`haex_hlc_no_sync`, `haex_column_hlcs_no_sync`,
     `haex_column_sigs_no_sync`) or any `haex_crdt_*_no_sync` bookkeeping
     table; the crate prepares that metadata only after HLC initialization
     and trigger installation. The plain data columns
     (`installation_uuid`, `vault_device_uuid`, alias, timestamps) are
     written normally.
  4. On Genesis (empty `vault_identity`), generates the vault identity
     keypair and inserts the singleton `vault_identity` row in the same
     transaction. On any other open, verifies the row is present.
  5. Returns the vault-device UUID. The crate atomically commits the bootstrap
     rows and result, then uses that UUID as the HLC node id for this open.

  The whole sequence is one transaction: the vault-identity row, the
  `known_devices` row, and the returned UUID commit or roll back together.

- **`SignatureProvider`** — signs the canonical column preimage supplied to
  `sign_column`, using the vault identity keypair. Verification is a later
  sync concern; holzi ships the signatures now so the deferred sync layer
  needs no migration over populated tables.

- **`MigrationSource`** — enumerates the holzi-owned migrations below.
  haex-crdt's own bookkeeping migrations (`_no_sync`-suffixed tables and the
  three `_no_sync`-suffixed metadata columns the CRDT transformer adds to
  every synced table) are separate and shipped by the crate.

Holzi also passes **`trigger_version: i32`** in `DatabaseConfig`. This is
haex-crdt's own trigger-schema version; holzi passes
`haex_crdt::DEFAULT_TRIGGER_VERSION` verbatim and bumps it only in lockstep
with a crate-required upgrade.

### holzi-owned data layer

Tables holzi ships via its `MigrationSource`. Installed as CRDT-tracked
tables via `install_crdt(table, opts)` unless marked `_no_sync`. The MVP
ships only the first two; the rest are named here so the deferred sync layer
lands on already-CRDT-tracked tables.

- **`vault_identity`** (singleton row) — the vault identity keypair (private
  key + public key). Present from Genesis; copied along with the `.db`, so
  every replica of the same vault shares this row. Private key material
  never leaves the encrypted DB.
- **`known_devices`** — one row per (vault × installation) that has ever
  opened this vault. `installation_uuid` matches the value stored in
  `<AppLocalData>/installation-id` on that installation's host and is the
  bootstrap hook's immutable primary-key lookup. `vault_device_uuid` (the HLC node id for
  this replica), alias, first-seen timestamp, and (later, with sync) an
  iroh node id are the further columns. The primary-key value is carried in
  `row_pks`; the further columns are plain CRDT-tracked fields, so every
  replica sees the full row set once sync lands. Note that a peer who holds
  two of a user's vaults can then
  correlate them on installation UUIDs — this is judged acceptable: any
  peer that holds two vaults of the same user already has stronger
  correlation signals (iroh node id, access-timing, granted scopes), and
  the design does not attempt cross-vault unlinkability against such
  peers.

Post-MVP additions (mentioned here to reserve names, not shipped): a
capability/grant table for cross-device authorization once sync lands, and
whatever the deferred cross-user-sharing design decides on for revocation.

### Node-ID collision detection (post-MVP)

The vault-device UUID must be unique per replica or CRDT conflict resolution
stops being deterministic. With `known_devices` keyed by installation UUID,
the invariant holds by construction as long as installation UUIDs are
unique. It can break only when the installation UUID file itself is
duplicated: VM clone, `rsync -a` of the entire app data directory,
full-system backup restore. Both replicas then look up the same
`known_devices` row and get the same vault-device UUID.

Holzi cannot detect this at open time on a single-install host. Once the
sync layer is in place, the invariant MUST be enforced by the sync layer:
on the first exchange with any peer, if the peer's advertised vault-device
UUID matches the local one, both sides raise a hard error and refuse to
sync until one side is regenerated. This is a post-MVP requirement, listed
here so the sync design accounts for it from day one.

**Never permitted**: the same `.db` open in two processes at once. `fs2`
prevents it on one host. Across a shared network mount or a cloud-sync
folder it cannot be prevented reliably — services like Dropbox replicate
byte ranges rather than transactions — so this is a documented
anti-requirement, and startup SHOULD warn when an instance path looks like a
known sync folder.

### Error mapping

The direct `haex-crdt::Error` variants map to `HolziError` as follows. Errors
returned through haex-crdt's internal `DatabaseError` conversion are surfaced
as `CrdtInit { reason }` until the crate exposes a typed top-level variant.

| haex-crdt variant | HolziError variant | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Sqlite(error)` | `CrdtSqlite { reason: error.to_string() }` | SQL/SQLCipher failure |
| `Io(error)` | `CrdtIo { reason: error.to_string() }` | I/O failure |
| `Hlc(reason)` | `CrdtHlc { reason }` | HLC/provider failure |
| `DeviceIdMismatch { expected, supplied }` | `DeviceIdMismatch { expected, supplied }` | not expected in normal operation — haex-crdt 0.3.0+ removed `reconcile_device_id`; this maps only a defensive `HlcService::initialize_in_place` self-check |
| `SignatureVerificationFailed { first_failed_change }` | `CrdtSignatureVerificationFailed { first_failed_change }` | remote batch is rejected atomically |
| `UnexpectedSignatureUnderNoop` | `CrdtUnexpectedSignatureUnderNoop` | transport/provider configuration error |
| `MigrationMissingFromSource { journal, name }` | `MigrationMissingFromSource { journal, name }` | catastrophic; source and journal are retained |
| `MigrationContentDrift { name, expected, found }` | `MigrationContentDrift { name, expected, found }` | catastrophic; abort |
| `MigrationCompatibility { reason }` | `MigrationCompatibility { reason }` | incompatible legacy schema |
| `CrdtAlreadyInstalled { table }` | `CrdtAlreadyInstalled { table }` | logic error in holzi's bootstrap |
| `Message(reason)` | `CrdtInit { reason }` | catch-all for the pinned crate's database-layer conversion |

At the pinned revision, filesystem-level lock collisions are converted inside
haex-crdt to `Error::Message`, so Holzi MUST NOT claim a typed
`VaultAlreadyOpenElsewhere` mapping from the crate yet. Once haex-crdt exposes
that condition as a typed top-level error, Holzi may map it to the distinct
`VaultAlreadyOpenElsewhere` variant. It remains distinct from
`InstanceAlreadyActive` (a process-internal `AppState.active_instance ==
Some(_)`).

## Commands

### `list_instances`

Scans `<AppLocalData>/instances/` for `.db` files (excluding the `.trash/` subdirectory and pending Genesis files) and returns metadata.

```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn list_instances(
    app: AppHandle,
) -> Result<Vec<InstanceInfo>, HolziError>;
```

**Frontend call**:

```ts
const list = await invoke<InstanceInfo[]>('list_instances')
```

**Returns**: `InstanceInfo[]` sorted by `lastAccess` descending. See `types.md`.

**Failure modes**:

- `HolziError::PathResolution` — `AppLocalData` cannot be resolved (rare, catastrophic).
- `HolziError::Io` — directory read failed (permissions).

---

### `create_instance`

Creates a new vault under `<AppLocalData>/instances/`: opens a fresh SQLCipher DB, runs holzi's migrations, and generates the vault identity keypair. No pairing, no join — the MVP has one command for creating a vault.

```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn create_instance(
    app: AppHandle,
    state: State<'_, AppState>,
    args: CreateInstanceArgs,
) -> Result<CreateInstanceResult, HolziError>;

pub struct CreateInstanceArgs {
    pub name: String,
    pub passphrase: String,
}

pub struct CreateInstanceResult {
    pub info: InstanceInfo,
}
```

**Preconditions**: `name` matches `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_\-]{0,63}$`; passphrase meets min-length policy; no active instance in `AppState`.

**Internal choreography**:

1. Validate `name` and passphrase policy in-process (haex-crdt accepts opaque strings; policy is holzi's job).
2. Ensure `<AppLocalData>/installation-id` exists — read it if present, otherwise mint a fresh v4 UUID and write it (fsync). This file is one-time-per-installation, not per-vault; it may already exist from earlier holzi use on this host.
3. Write `<name>.db.pending` as an empty marker, then create `<name>.db` as the candidate path in `<AppLocalData>/instances/`. Marker presence controls publication.
4. Call `Database::open` with `create_if_missing: true` and a `HolziBootstrap` implementation of [`DatabaseBootstrap`](#provider-implementations). Inside the transaction the crate opens for the hook, holzi generates the vault identity keypair, inserts the singleton `vault_identity` row, mints the vault-device UUID, and inserts the self-`known_devices` row. Those bootstrap rows and the returned UUID commit together or roll back together. Only after that commit does the crate initialize HLC and install triggers; a later failure does not roll the bootstrap transaction back, so this command's failure cleanup removes the candidate database and pending marker.
5. Bind `AppState.active_instance = Some(info)`.
6. Flush the DB and directory, remove `<name>.db.pending`, flush the directory again. Marker removal is the durable commit point.
7. Emit `instance-list-changed`.

**Postconditions on success**: `<name>.db` exists and is unlocked and active; `<AppLocalData>/installation-id` exists (it may have already existed); the `vault_identity` and self-`known_devices` rows are written; the pending marker is gone.

**Postconditions on failure**: On any failure before step 7, drop every `Arc<Database>` clone, verify the file lock is released, and remove `<name>.db` and `<name>.db.pending`. Leave `<AppLocalData>/installation-id` in place — it is shared with any other vaults on this host and MUST NOT be deleted by a per-vault operation. A crash between steps 3 and 7 leaves the pending marker; startup orphan-cleanup removes it together with the sibling `.db`.

**Failure modes**:

- `HolziError::NameConflict { name }` — a `.db` with that name already exists.
- `HolziError::InvalidName { reason }` — regex mismatch.
- `HolziError::WeakPassphrase { reason }` — policy failure.
- `HolziError::InstanceAlreadyActive` — another instance is currently active in `AppState`.
- `HolziError::MigrationMissingFromSource { .. }` / `HolziError::MigrationContentDrift { .. }` / `HolziError::MigrationCompatibility { reason }` / `HolziError::CrdtSqlite { reason }` / `HolziError::CrdtIo { reason }` / `HolziError::CrdtHlc { reason }` / `HolziError::CrdtAlreadyInstalled { table }` / `HolziError::CrdtInit { reason }` — see [Error mapping](#error-mapping). All are catastrophic during `create_instance`; the backend rolls back per postconditions above.

---

### `open_instance`

Opens an existing `.db` (whether created locally, imported from another install, or restored from backup): unlocks SQLCipher, wires the CRDT layer, and marks the instance active in `AppState`. There is no rekey, no restore-pairing handoff, no adoption gate — the vault identity in the DB is authoritative, and the vault-device UUID for this replica comes from the `known_devices` lookup keyed by the local installation UUID (inserted with a fresh UUID on first open of this vault by this installation).

```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn open_instance(
    app: AppHandle,
    state: State<'_, AppState>,
    args: OpenInstanceArgs,
) -> Result<InstanceInfo, HolziError>;

pub struct OpenInstanceArgs {
    pub name: String,
    pub passphrase: String,
}
```

**Preconditions**: `<name>.db` exists and is not a pending Genesis database (Genesis is identified by the sibling `<name>.db.pending` marker).

**Internal choreography**:

1. Ensure `<AppLocalData>/installation-id` exists (mint and fsync if absent).
2. Call `Database::open` with `create_if_missing: false` and a `HolziBootstrap` implementation. Inside the crate-owned transaction, holzi's hook reads the installation UUID, looks it up in the `known_devices.installation_uuid` column, and either reuses the found `vault_device_uuid` or mints a fresh one and inserts the complete row. The returned UUID becomes the HLC node id for this open.
3. If another instance was active, stop its runtime; then bind `AppState.active_instance = Some(info)` and refresh the DB mtime as `lastAccess`.
4. Emit `instance-list-changed`.

**Postconditions on success**: SQLCipher unlocked; `AppState.active_instance = Some(...)`; DB mtime refreshed; `known_devices` contains a row matching the local installation UUID. If another instance was active, it is fully closed before the new one becomes visible.

**Atomic switch and rollback**: the state lock is held throughout. Validate the requested file and SQLCipher credentials while the previous runtime remains active; on validation failure, no close or state transition occurs. Only after the new candidate opens successfully does the previous runtime stop. On candidate startup failure, drop every candidate handle and keep the previous runtime; the copy remains on disk for retry. A `known_devices` row inserted during a failed candidate open remains in the DB — it is harmless (an unused entry for this installation) and will be picked up on the next successful open. A failed unlock retains the file; deletion requires an explicit discard action or conclusive validation that the file is not a holzi instance.

**Failure modes**:

- `HolziError::NotFound { name }` — no such file.
- `HolziError::WrongPassphrase` — SQLCipher rejected. **The frontend MUST NOT expose whether the error was `NotFound` vs `WrongPassphrase`** (FR-021); it renders both as a generic "Öffnen fehlgeschlagen". The typed error is for logs and telemetry only.
- `HolziError::NotAValidInstance { reason }` — the database or SQLCipher format is invalid.
- `HolziError::Io` — read error.
- Any haex-crdt-mapped variant listed in [Error mapping](#error-mapping) if migrations or CRDT installation fail.

---

### `close_instance`

Closes the currently-active instance: shuts down Nostr relay, disconnects iroh peer, drops the last `Arc<Database>` clone (haex-crdt closes the SQLCipher handle and releases its `fs2` lock as a consequence of the last-Arc drop, not through a separate crate call), clears `AppState.active_instance`. Idempotent — succeeds if nothing is active.

```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn close_instance(
    app: AppHandle,
    state: State<'_, AppState>,
) -> Result<(), HolziError>;
```

**Postcondition on success**: no `Arc<Database>` clone survives inside `AppState` or any subsystem holzi owns. If a subsystem is still holding a clone at drop time, `close_instance` MUST error with `CloseFailed` rather than returning `Ok`; a returned `Ok` implies the file lock is released and a subsequent `open_instance` of the same file will succeed on this host.

After a successful close of an active instance, emit `instance-list-changed { reason: 'closed', affectedName: name }`. The event requires the `AppHandle` dependency; an idempotent close with no active instance emits no mutation event.

**Failure modes**:

- `HolziError::CloseFailed { reason }` — a subsystem shutdown returned an error. State is left as clean as possible; caller may retry.

---

### `import_instance_file`

Copies an external `.db` file into `<AppLocalData>/instances/`. Structural validation happens before copying; SQLCipher credential validation is completed by `open_instance`. The copy carries the source's `known_devices` rows unchanged. On first open, the `DatabaseBootstrap` hook reuses the row matching this installation's UUID when the source came from the same installation, otherwise it inserts a new row with a fresh vault-device UUID.

```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn import_instance_file(
    app: AppHandle,
    state: State<'_, AppState>,
    args: ImportInstanceArgs,
) -> Result<ImportInstanceResult, HolziError>;

pub struct ImportInstanceArgs {
    pub source_path: String,        // External path returned by plugin-dialog; never a managed path
    pub on_conflict: ConflictPolicy,
}

pub enum ConflictPolicy {
    Rename,      // Append -2, -3, … (default)
    Overwrite,   // Replace existing (frontend must confirm first)
    Abort,       // Fail with NameConflict
}

pub struct ImportInstanceResult {
    pub info: InstanceInfo,
    pub renamed_from: Option<String>,  // Set if on_conflict=Rename triggered
}
```

**Postconditions on success**: the destination `<name>.db` exists, and `instance-list-changed { reason: 'imported', affectedName: info.name }` is emitted after the durable copy completes.

**Notes**:

- `source_path` is the external file path returned by `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog`; it is the only path accepted from the frontend. It is not a managed-instance path. The command validates that it is a regular file and that the extension is `.db`.
- SQLCipher page validation is deferred until `open_instance`, where the operator supplies the passphrase. The `DatabaseBootstrap` hook reuses the matching `known_devices.installation_uuid` row for a same-installation copy, or inserts one with a fresh vault-device UUID for a copy from another installation.
- Copy uses a crash-safe publish protocol: write the database to a temporary file in the managed directory and fsync it; fsync the directory; atomically rename the temporary database to `<name>.db`; then fsync the directory again before emitting the import event. For `ConflictPolicy::Overwrite`, stage as `<name>.db.importing`, rename the old `<name>.db` to an operation-specific backup, atomically rename the staged file into `<name>.db`, fsync the directory, and only then remove the backup. A crash mid-import leaves either the original target intact or a `.importing` file that startup deletes without opening it. The source file is never modified or moved.
- For `ConflictPolicy::Overwrite`, the command checks the target name while holding the `AppState` lock and rejects replacement if that name is the active instance. The frontend must close that instance explicitly before retrying overwrite. On open, the new file reuses the row matching this installation's UUID when present; otherwise bootstrap inserts one with a fresh vault-device UUID.

**Failure modes**:

- `HolziError::NotAValidInstance { reason }` — the source is not a regular `.db` file or fails structural validation before copying.
- `HolziError::NameConflict { name }` — only when `on_conflict = Abort`.
- `HolziError::InstanceActive { name }` — `Overwrite` targets the active instance.
- `HolziError::Io` — copy failed.

---

### `move_instance_to_trash`

Soft-deletes an instance by moving `<name>.db` into `<AppLocalData>/instances/.trash/<name>-<timestamp>.db`. Refuses if the target is currently the active instance.

```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn move_instance_to_trash(
    app: AppHandle,
    state: State<'_, AppState>,
    args: TrashInstanceArgs,
) -> Result<(), HolziError>;

pub struct TrashInstanceArgs {
    pub name: String,
}
```

**Postconditions on success**: the source database is absent from the managed root, the trashed `.db` exists under `.trash/`, and `instance-list-changed { reason: 'trashed', affectedName: name }` is emitted only after the move completes. `<AppLocalData>/installation-id` is unaffected — it is installation-scoped, not per-vault. If the operator later restores the trashed file (out of scope for v1), the `known_devices` row for this installation is still inside the file and will be reused; a new row is inserted only if the file is opened on a different installation.

**Failure modes**:

- `HolziError::NotFound { name }`.
- `HolziError::InstanceActive { name }` — refuses to trash the running instance.
- `HolziError::Io`.

---

### `forget_instance` *(out of v1 scope)*

Not exposed in v1. Because the list is a directory scan, removing an item while retaining its file would require persistent exclusion metadata. The only v1 removal action is `move_instance_to_trash`.

```

## Frontend error handling

- `WrongPassphrase` and `NotFound` MUST both surface to the operator as a single generic message (FR-021). Do not branch UI on the discriminator.
- All other errors surface via `sonner` toast with the localized message from `i18n/locales/{de,en}.json` under `errors.<kind>`.
- Fallback for unknown discriminators: log to console + generic toast.
