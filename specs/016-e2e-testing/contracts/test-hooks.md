# Contract: the controls a scenario may reach

**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](../plan.md)

FR-014: every control a scenario needs is reachable without depending on displayed text or the interface
language (the interface is German by default and its texts change). Use what already exists; add only
what is missing, as a `data-testid` attribute with a kebab-case name. An attribute changes neither
behavior nor appearance.

## Existing hooks

They are part of this contract now: renaming one means updating the helpers in the same change.

| Control                          | Hook                                               | Where                                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Unlock: passphrase field         | `#unlock-passphrase`                               | `src/components/onboarding/UnlockSheet.vue` |
| Unlock: submit button            | `[form="unlock-form"]`                             | same                                        |
| Create: name field               | `#create-name`                                     | `src/components/onboarding/CreateSheet.vue` |
| Create: passphrase, confirmation | `#create-passphrase`, `#create-passphrase-confirm` | same                                        |
| Create: submit button            | `[form="create-form"]`                             | same                                        |
| Closing page: the spinner        | `.ring`                                            | `public/closing.html`                       |
| Where the app is                 | `location.pathname` (`/workspace/…`, `/chat/…`)    | routes                                      |

## Hooks to add

| Hook                                                             | Element                                                           | File                                                     | Lines added |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `data-testid="instance-entry"` and `data-instance-name="<name>"` | The button of each instance in the start list                     | `src/components/onboarding/InstancesList.vue` (44 lines) | 2           |
| `data-testid="open-launcher"`                                    | The round button that opens the workspace app launcher            | `src/components/shell/ShellDesktop.vue`                  | 1           |
| `data-testid="open-chat"`                                        | The Chat tile in the workspace app launcher                       | `src/components/shell/ShellLauncher.vue`                 | 1           |
| `data-testid="lock-instance-sidebar"`                            | The lock button in the sidebar, shown from the `md` breakpoint up | `src/components/chat/ThreadSidebar.vue`                  | 1           |
| `data-testid="lock-instance-header"`                             | The always-visible lock button in the chat header                 | `src/components/chat/ChatHeader.vue`                     | 1           |
| `data-testid="nav-back"`, `data-testid="nav-forward"`            | A window's back/forward buttons (spec 020)                        | `src/components/shell/ShellNavButtons.vue`               | 1           |

`data-instance-name` carries the instance's name, which is data, not interface text, so an entry can be
found by name without reading what is displayed.

The two lock hooks are separate, not a shared one: the sidebar hook identifies the desktop sidebar
control, while the header hook identifies the lock control that remains reachable in the Shell window's
header at every viewport size. Scenarios use the header hook because the Shell window can be smaller than
the virtual desktop even when the sidebar itself is in desktop mode.

Not added now: hooks for the composer, the message list or settings. Each scenario that needs one adds
it with the scenario, so no hook exists without a use.

## Finding a control

```ts
instance.click('open-launcher') // [data-testid="open-launcher"]
instance.click('open-chat') // [data-testid="open-chat"]
instance.click('#unlock-passphrase') // a selector starting with # . [ is used as is
```

A name without a selector character is a `data-testid`. If several elements match, the displayed one is
used; if none is displayed by the deadline, the call fails and names the hook.

## What the closing page must look like

Not a hook but a contract the closing-page scenario relies on: no text at all, exactly one `.ring`, and a
body background equal to the page's own `--page` colour for the colour scheme in force
(`public/closing.html`, spec 013).
