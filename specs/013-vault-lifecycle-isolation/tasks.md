# Tasks: Vault Lifecycle Isolation

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/013-vault-lifecycle-isolation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/tauri-commands.md,
contracts/frontend-surface.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Included as mandatory, not optional. The spaex constitution requires test code in files
separate from production code and one runnable check per piece of non-trivial logic. Rust tests live
in sibling `*_tests.rs` files declared with the repository's existing
`#[cfg(test)] #[path = "x_tests.rs"] mod x_tests;` idiom (see `src-tauri/src/voice.rs`) or under
`src-tauri/tests/`. Frontend tests are cases in the replay harness (`pnpm check:chat-state` for the
existing cases, `pnpm check:vault-lifecycle` for the new ones, both CI gates). No new test runner.
Async tests use paused time and channels, never arbitrary sleeps.

**Organization**: The plan's seven delivery stages, in the operator's order. Every stage compiles and
passes its own checks. Stage 1 (secret hygiene) does not depend on the gate and comes first; Stage 2
is the foundation that Stages 3 to 5 need. User story labels: US1 close locks everything, US2 a new
vault sees nothing of the old one, US3 the passphrase never lingers, US4 two app processes side by
side, US5 reads never fail.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependency on another unchecked task)
- **[Story]**: US1 to US5 (only in story phases; the setup, foundational and polish phases have none)
- All paths are repository-relative and written in full: Rust files start with `src-tauri/`, frontend
  files with `src/` or `scripts/`.
- Commits follow Conventional Commits, one per checkpoint, **without** any agent or model trailer
  (constitution MUST NOT). Work lands on `main` through a PR from this branch; no squash-merge.
- Inside the Nix dev shell: `nix develop --command scripts/with-nix-host-bridge.sh cargo ...` for
  Rust, `nix develop --command pnpm ...` for the frontend.
- `pnpm generate:ts-types` calls plain `cargo`, which fails in the Nix dev shell without the host
  bridge. Wherever a task says to regenerate the bindings, run the script's two steps by hand: the
  export test through
  `nix develop --command scripts/with-nix-host-bridge.sh cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml export_bindings`,
  then `sed -i -E 's/[[:space:]]+$//' src/types/bindings/*.ts`.
- `cargo test` rewrites `src/types/bindings/*.ts` with trailing whitespace. After ordinary test runs,
  `git checkout -- src/types/bindings/`. When a task intentionally changes a binding, regenerate it
  with the two steps above (the second one strips the whitespace) and commit the result.
- **Oversized files must not grow** (line counts recorded in T003): `models/commands.rs`,
  `chat/commands.rs`, `chat/model_loading.rs`, `providers/mod.rs`, `src/pages/chat/[instance].vue`,
  `scripts/check-chat-state.ts`. Edit call sites in place; new logic goes into new small files.

---

## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Work happens in `.worktrees/013-vault-lifecycle-isolation` on branch
      `013-vault-lifecycle-isolation` with a real `pnpm install` (no symlinked `node_modules`).
- [x] T002 Already on this branch and not to be redone: the tokio-util `rt` feature (`f4814b6`), the
      `active_model_info` fix without the operation slot (FR-025, `fedcfa8`), and the `tauri` `test`
      dev-dependency (own commit). The spike lives only on the local branch `spike/vault-gateway` and
      never merges; read it with `git show spike/vault-gateway:src-tauri/tests/spike_vault_gateway.rs`.
- [x] T003 Record the baseline in the "Baseline" section at the end of this file before any edit:
      `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` pass count, `pnpm check:chat-state` test count,
      and the results of `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm typecheck:scripts`, `pnpm lint`,
      `pnpm format:check`, plus `wc -l` of the six oversized files listed above.
- [x] T004 Decided by the operator on 2026-09-21: the fix commit `fedcfa8` travels in PR A together
      with the docs, and any available `gh` account may be used for pushes and PRs, including the
      haex-crdt repository. The `haexhub` account is read-only on this repository, so pushes use
      `haexmas`; restore the previously active account afterwards. Recorded in the Baseline section.
- [x] T005 [P] Extract the replay harness. Create `scripts/lib/chat-state-harness.ts` and move into
      it, from `scripts/check-chat-state.ts`, the sandbox machinery: the transpile cache,
      `runComposable`, `createTauriDouble`, `DEFAULT_INVOKE_HANDLERS`, `RETURN_STATEMENT`,
      `createChatState`, `flush` and any helper they need. Export what the test bodies use. Test
      bodies, names and count stay unchanged (compare with T003). Both files stay under 500 lines
      where possible; `check-chat-state.ts` must get shorter. Update its header comment (extraction
      done). `pnpm typecheck:scripts` already covers `scripts/**/*.ts`. Commit
      `refactor(scripts): extract the chat-state replay harness`.
- [x] T006 Depends on T005. Create `scripts/check-vault-lifecycle.ts` importing the shared harness,
      with one smoke case that boots `createChatState()`. Add `"check:vault-lifecycle"` to
      `package.json` next to `check:chat-state` and a step after it in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
      (same shape as the `check:chat-state` step). New frontend cases in later phases go in this file,
      never into the oversized `check-chat-state.ts`.

---

## Phase 2: Stage 1 — Secret hygiene in Rust (US3, FR-013 to FR-015, SC-004, SC-005)

**Goal**: The passphrase is held in an erasing, redacted type and is never cloned. Independent of the
gate; the existing open flow keeps working.

**Independent test**: `cargo test` proves redaction and erasure; a manual unlock and wrong-passphrase
attempt still behave as before.

### Tests for Stage 1 (write first; expected to fail until the implementation tasks land)

- [x] T007 [P] [US3] Create `src-tauri/src/instances/passphrase_tests.rs` with cases: (a) `{:?}` and
      `{:#?}` of `Passphrase`, `OpenInstanceArgs` and `CreateInstanceArgs`, built from a distinctive
      literal, never contain the literal and do contain `<redacted>`; (b) `Passphrase` deserializes
      from a JSON string; (c) calling `zeroize()` on a `Passphrase` leaves `as_str()` empty; (d) a
      static assertion that `Passphrase` is `ZeroizeOnDrop`; (e) `From<&str>` and `From<String>`.

### Implementation for Stage 1

- [x] T008 [US3] In `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` add `zeroize` 1.x as a direct dependency with the `serde`
      feature. Verify with `cargo metadata` that it still resolves to 1.9.0 and that the
      `Cargo.lock` diff is only holzi's own dependency list and `zeroize` listing `serde` (no new
      package). Commit
      `build(deps): depend on zeroize directly`.
- [x] T009 [US3] Create `src-tauri/src/instances/passphrase.rs` (declare it in `src-tauri/src/instances/mod.rs`): a
      newtype `Passphrase(Zeroizing<String>)`. Data-model rule verbatim: "Erased on drop; never
      cloned; excluded from `Debug` (prints `<redacted>`)". No `Clone`. `Deserialize` from a string,
      `as_str()`, `From<&str>`, `From<String>`, `Zeroize` delegating to the inner string, and
      `ZeroizeOnDrop`. Declare `passphrase_tests.rs` at the bottom with the `#[path]` idiom.
- [x] T010 [US3] Change `OpenInstanceArgs` (`src-tauri/src/instances/open.rs`, around line 34) and
      `CreateInstanceArgs` (`src-tauri/src/instances/create.rs`) to `passphrase: Passphrase`, keeping the wire
      shape `{ name, passphrase }` and adding `#[ts(type = "string")]` so the binding stays `string`.
      Keeping `#[derive(Debug)]` is now safe because the field type redacts.
- [x] T011 [US3] Remove every passphrase `String` clone. In `src-tauri/src/instances/open.rs` move
      `args.passphrase` into an `Arc<Passphrase>` shared by the validation task and the open task
      (Arc clones are handles, not copies) and pass `as_str()` to `pragma_update` and
      `open_existing_database`. In `src-tauri/src/instances/create.rs` move the passphrase into the blocking
      open task (the clone near line 105). No `.clone()` on the secret remains.
- [x] T012 [US3] Compiler-driven sweep of tests and fixtures that build these args: run
      `rg -n "OpenInstanceArgs|CreateInstanceArgs" src-tauri/src src-tauri/tests` and switch the
      literals to `Passphrase::from(...)`.
- [x] T013 [US3] Review every use of the passphrase for leaks (FR-015): a case-insensitive `rg`
      search for passphrase over `src-tauri/src`, checking `log::`, `format!`, `to_string`,
      `Display` and error construction. Record "no leak found" or the fixes made in the Baseline
      section. Errors such as `HolziError::WrongPassphrase` must stay fieldless.
- [x] T014 [US3] Regenerate the bindings (see the format notes at the top) and confirm `src/types/bindings/OpenInstanceArgs.ts`
      and `CreateInstanceArgs.ts` are unchanged (still `string`). Any other diff is investigated,
      not committed blindly.
- [x] T015 [US3] **Checkpoint Stage 1**: `cargo fmt --check`, `pnpm lint:rust` (both feature sets),
      `cargo test`, then `git checkout -- src/types/bindings/`. Commit
      `feat(instances): keep the vault passphrase in an erasing, redacted type`.

---

## Phase 3: Stage 2 — Foundational: the gate, the tracker, the wrapper (blocks Stages 3 to 5)

**Goal**: One gateway that every request passes, one tracker that knows what is still running, and a
database handle that carries a tracker token. Nothing changes for users yet, because no code asks for
a close until Stage 3.

**Independent test**: `cargo test` covers the phase machine, the drain ladder, the handle guard and
the wrapper over the Tauri mock runtime; the app behaves exactly as before.

### Preparation

- [x] T016 Graphify consultation before authoring the new named artifacts (`VaultGate::run`,
      `CloseEffects`, `retry_while_locked`, `VaultDb`). The worktree has no `graphify-out/`, so run
      the queries from the primary checkout snapshot (read only): "run a future until a cancellation
      token fires", "retry an operation until a file lock is free", "abstract the side effects of
      closing so tests can record them", "wrap a shared handle with a drop guard counter". Add the
      candidates and decisions to the table in `research.md` R10. If a query fails or returns
      nonsense, warn, continue, and flag the skipped consultation in the same table (constitution).
- [x] T017 Confirm the app-scoped allow-list by reading each command (do not trust the list). Locate
      each with `rg -n "fn <name>" src-tauri/src`: `close_instance`, `list_instances`,
      `get_hardware_info`, `list_catalog`, `catalog_recommend_tiers`, `list_stt_catalog`,
      `stt_recommend_tiers`. For each, check that neither it nor any helper it calls reaches
      `active_database`, `ChatState` or vault data. Record a verdict per command as a table under
      `research.md` R3. Remove a command from the list in `contracts/tauri-commands.md` if it fails.
      Also read `list_installed_stt_models` and `download_stt_model`; they stay default-deny unless
      they are clearly app-scoped and needed on the unlock screen, and the decision is recorded.

### Tests for Stage 2 (write first; expected to fail until the implementation tasks land)

- [x] T018 [P] Create `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/gate_tests.rs`, quoting the data-model rules: "`phase` only
      moves forward (`Idle` → `Active` → `Closing`), and `Idle` → `Closing` is allowed"; "`cancel`
      fires at most once, on the first transition into `Closing`"; "A second close request changes
      nothing and reports that a close is already running (FR-002)". Also: `begin_session` while
      `Active` is `VaultAlreadyActive`, while `Closing` is `VaultClosed`; `begin_session` from `Idle`
      succeeds exactly once when two threads race.
- [x] T019 [P] Create `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/drain_tests.rs` with `#[tokio::test(start_paused = true)]` and a
      blocking closure that waits on a channel the test releases, so no wall-clock sleeps are needed:
      a cooperative task yields `Drained`; a task that ignores the token yields `DrainedAfterAbort`;
      a blocking closure still running at the limit yields `Stuck`, and the call returns within the
      total limit (about 3 s of virtual time). Add a plain `#[test]` for the forced end: the action
      given to `hard_end_after` runs once after the grace period and never before it (a few
      milliseconds of real time, waiting on a channel, not a sleep).
- [x] T020 [P] Create `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/db_tests.rs`: a `VaultDb` clone keeps the tracker non-empty
      while any clone is alive and lets it empty after the last drop; `Deref` reaches the `Database`.
      Open a throwaway SQLCipher database the way `src-tauri/src/instances/startup_tests.rs` does (`tempfile`).
- [x] T021 [P] Create `src-tauri/tests/vault_gateway.rs` over the Tauri mock runtime (the `tauri` `test`
      dev-dependency is already present): in `Idle` and `Active` every command passes; in `Closing`
      a non-allow-listed command is rejected at once with `{"kind":"VaultClosed"}` and its body never
      runs (assert with a counter), an allow-listed command passes, and a command that is not in
      either list (a "new" command) is denied, proving default-deny.

### Implementation for Stage 2

- [x] T022 Create `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/mod.rs` (declare `mod vault_gate;` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`): `VaultGate`,
      cheap to `Clone` (fields behind `Arc`), with `phase: Mutex<VaultPhase>` (short-held std
      mutex), `cancel: CancellationToken`, `tasks: TaskTracker`, `aborts: Mutex<Vec<AbortHandle>>`.
      `VaultPhase` is the enum `Idle | Active | Closing`. API: `begin_session()`,
      `ensure_can_open()`, `request_close()` (reports whether this call was the first), `is_closing()`,
      `token()`, `spawn(fut)` and `spawn_blocking(f)` (both tracked; `spawn` uses
      `TaskTracker::spawn_on` with `tauri::async_runtime::handle().inner()` so tasks run on Tauri's
      runtime, registers the abort handle and prunes finished handles), `run(fut)` (races the future
      against the token and returns `Err(HolziError::VaultClosed)` when the token wins), and a way to
      hand out a tracker token. Also `ClosePolicy` (`Relaunch` | `Exit`) and `close_policy()` (debug
      builds return `Exit` until T048 says otherwise). Keep every new file under 500 lines.
- [x] T023 Create `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/drain.rs`: the ladder from research R5 (fire the token, wait up to
      the cooperative window, abort registered tasks, wait until the total limit) returning
      `DrainOutcome` (`Drained` | `DrainedAfterAbort` | `Stuck`, exactly the data-model table). The
      deadlines are named constants with a `ponytail:` comment: fixed 1 s and 3 s, ceiling "not
      adaptive to slow disks or busy machines", upgrade path "make them configurable in one place".
      Add `hard_end_after(grace, action)`: it starts a plain `std::thread` (independent of tokio and
      of the window event loop) that waits the grace period and then runs `action`. Its named
      constant is 500 ms, with a `ponytail:` comment: fixed 0.5 s, ceiling "a stuck exit path costs
      half a second more", upgrade path "none needed".
- [x] T024 Create `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/db.rs`: `VaultDb { db: Arc<Database>, _token: TaskTrackerToken }`
      with `Clone` and `Deref<Target = Database>`, exactly the data-model entity.
- [x] T025 Create `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/invoke.rs`: `APP_SCOPED_COMMANDS` (the list confirmed in T017) and
      `VaultGate::wrap`, returning a closure `Fn(Invoke<R>) -> bool`. It reads the name with
      `invoke.message.command()`; in `Closing` and not allow-listed it calls
      `invoke.resolver.reject(HolziError::VaultClosed)` and returns `true`, otherwise it calls the
      inner handler.
- [x] T026 Add `VaultClosed` and `VaultAlreadyActive` to `src-tauri/src/error.rs` (fieldless; messages "The
      vault is closed" and "A vault is already open in this app process"). Do not remove
      `CloseFailed` yet. Regenerate the bindings (see the format notes at the top) and commit them.
- [x] T027 Encapsulate the vault state. In `src-tauri/src/state.rs` make `active_instance` private and add the
      methods from the data-model table (`database`, `install`, `take`); `AppState::new` takes a
      `VaultGate` clone so `active_database(&State<AppState>)` in `src-tauri/src/state_utils.rs` keeps its
      signature and now returns a `VaultDb` (or `VaultClosed` / `NoActiveInstance`). `install` will
      call `begin_session` under the same lock in Stage 4; for now it publishes only.
- [x] T028 In `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` build the gate once, pass a clone to `AppState::new`, `.manage(gate)`, and
      register `invoke_handler(gate.wrap(tauri::generate_handler![...]))`. The handler list itself
      is unchanged.
- [x] T029 Compiler-driven sweep to `VaultDb`: the callers in `src-tauri/src/chat/model_loading.rs`,
      `src-tauri/src/chat/default_model.rs`, `src-tauri/src/chat/commands.rs`, `src-tauri/src/chat/thread_commands.rs`,
      `src-tauri/src/models/commands.rs`, `src-tauri/src/providers/mod.rs`, `src-tauri/src/providers/connect.rs`,
      `src-tauri/src/storage/preferences_commands.rs`, `src-tauri/src/device/commands.rs` and `src-tauri/src/voice.rs`. Change
      types only (for example `Arc<Database>` parameters); no logic change and no net line growth in
      the oversized files. `src-tauri/src/instances/{open,create,close}.rs` keep reading the state through the
      new methods.
- [x] T030 [P] Update `data-model.md` where the implementation differs from it (for example
      `AppState` holds a gate clone, so `active_database` keeps its signature; `VaultDb` handling).
- [x] T031 **Checkpoint Stage 2**: `cargo fmt --check`, `pnpm lint:rust`, `cargo test`,
      `git checkout -- src/types/bindings/` (after committing the intended T026 bindings). Behavior is
      unchanged for users. Commit `feat(vault-gate): route every request through one gateway`.

## Phase 4: User Story 1 — Closing locks everything at once, every time (P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: FR-001 to FR-009, SC-001, SC-002. `close_instance` cannot fail, cancels the work, replaces
the page at once, drains within about 3 s and ends the process.

**Independent test**: quickstart scenarios 1, 2, 3 and 8: close with a streaming reply and a running
download; press close repeatedly; close by window; the process ends within about 4 s with no error.

### Manual checks that decide the design (record each outcome)

- [x] T032 [US1] Research R4: find where a static file must live so it is served in `pnpm dev` and
      present in the built output. Try `public/closing.html` at the repository root and
      `src/public/closing.html` (the Nuxt config sets `srcDir: 'src/'`). Check
      `http://localhost:3030/closing.html` under `pnpm dev` and `.output/public/closing.html` after the
      build command named in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (`beforeBuildCommand`). Keep the location
      that works. Replace **Open** in `research.md` R4 with the **Outcome**. If neither works, record
      that `about:blank` is used.
- [x] T033 [US1] Create `closing.html` at the location found in T032: a centered spinner and nothing
      else, **no text of any kind** (operator decision 2026-09-21, so nothing needs translating).
      Pure CSS: a bordered ring turned by a `@keyframes` rotation in an inline `<style>`
      (`style-src` allows `'unsafe-inline'`), no script (the CSP is `script-src 'self'`), no image,
      GIF or external resource, no vault data. The background follows `prefers-color-scheme` and
      matches the app's light and dark backgrounds so dark mode gets no white flash;
      `prefers-reduced-motion` may slow the rotation but must not hide the spinner. Update the
      "Closing page" section of `contracts/frontend-surface.md` accordingly.

### Tests for User Story 1 (write first; expected to fail until the implementation tasks land)

- [x] T034 [P] [US1] In `src-tauri/src/chat/session_tests.rs` add cases for `ChatState::reset_for_close`: it
      clears the loaded session, both approval maps, the tool cancellation slot, the current
      generation handle and the tool registry, and is idempotent.
- [x] T035 [P] [US1] Create `src-tauri/tests/vault_lifecycle_close.rs` using a recorder implementation of the
      close effects (defined in T039), a gate, a `ChatState`, a `VoiceState` and a throwaway
      database: (a) `close_instance` returns `Ok` at once while a tracked task that never finishes
      and a held operation slot exist (the old "operation still in progress" failure, FR-002);
      (b) a second call is `Ok` and repeats no effect; (c) phase 1 effects happen once and in order:
      gate closing, token fired, turn aborted, page navigated, list-changed emitted; (d) the process
      end is requested exactly once with the configured policy, for `Drained`, `DrainedAfterAbort` and
      `Stuck`, and the forced end is armed once after that request and fires when the fake effect
      does not end the process; (e) the database is dropped only after every `VaultDb` clone is dropped, and always
      before the process end; (f) after the close, the wrapper rejects a vault command over the mock
      runtime; (g) a turn started before the close is cancelled through the token.
- [x] T036 [P] [US1] Verify FR-008 by reading, then test any gap: `src-tauri/src/chat/turn/persist.rs` for how
      a cancelled turn persists (it must not look complete), and the staging cleanup in
      `src-tauri/src/models/download.rs` and `cleanup_staging_in_dir` in `src-tauri/src/models/import.rs` for partial
      downloads. Add a case to the existing sibling test files if a gap exists, and record the
      finding either way in the Baseline section.

- [x] T037 [P] [US1] Create `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/children_tests.rs`: after `register` of a
      spawned child (its own process group) `kill_all` ends it and a grandchild its shell started;
      a second `kill_all` is harmless; a child registered after `kill_all` is killed at once;
      dropping the guard removes the entry. Unix only (`#[cfg(unix)]`), using `sh` with a background
      `sleep`. Add cases to `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/drain_tests.rs`: the ladder calls `kill_all`
      before it returns `Drained`, `DrainedAfterAbort` or `Stuck`, and at the abort rung, so a thread
      that waits for its child is freed.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T038 [US1] Add `ChatState::reset_for_close` in `src-tauri/src/chat/session.rs` (currently 345 lines)
      reusing the existing fields and `abort_turn` semantics; do not duplicate the abort logic.
- [x] T039 [US1] Define the close effects: a small trait `CloseEffects` in
      `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/mod.rs` with four methods (show the closing page, emit
      `instance-list-changed` for a closed vault, request the end of the process for a
      `ClosePolicy`, force the end of the process for a `ClosePolicy`). Implement it
      for the real app in a new file `src-tauri/src/instances/close_effects.rs`: navigate the main
      webview with `Webview::navigate` to the current URL joined with `closing.html` (fallback
      `about:blank`), emit the event, and end the process with `AppHandle::request_restart()` for
      `Relaunch` or `AppHandle::exit(0)` for `Exit` (never `restart()`, research R2). The forced end
      is `tauri::process::restart(&app.env())` for `Relaunch` and `std::process::exit(0)` for
      `Exit`; it first calls `ChildRegistry::kill_all`, because a forced end skips the `Drop`-based
      kills. Failures are logged, never returned.
- [x] T040 [US1] Rewrite `src-tauri/src/instances/close.rs` per `contracts/tauri-commands.md`. Phase
      1 is synchronous and infallible: `gate.request_close()`, fire the token, `abort_turn` (reuse
      the existing function in `src-tauri/src/chat/commands.rs`, do not copy it), the page effect,
      the event, arm the outer forced end, start phase 2, return `Ok(())`. Phase 2
      (background, on a plain `tauri::async_runtime::spawn`, not tracked, because it is the task
      that drains the tracker): call `ChatState::reset_for_close` **first** (a delegate adapter in
      the session holds a `VaultDb`, so the drain would never finish otherwise), run the drain
      ladder, take the database out with `AppState::take`, drop it, call
      `VoiceState::invalidate_whisper_cache` (bounded), then request the end of the process and arm
      the forced end with `hard_end_after` and `CloseEffects::force_end`. The preload is cancelled
      in phase 1 without waiting (`ChatState::cancel_preload`): the drain waits for it, so a
      preload that ignores the signal cannot hold the close up. The command no longer calls
      `acquire_operation`.
- [x] T041 [US1] Delete `CloseFailed` from `src-tauri/src/error.rs`, remove the stale doc comment in
      `src-tauri/src/state.rs`, and regenerate the bindings (see the format notes at the top).
- [x] T042 [US1] Register session-scoped tasks with the gate and add the token where work runs long:
      the chat turn task (`src-tauri/src/chat/commands.rs`, the `spawn` around line 607) and the preload
      (`src-tauri/src/chat/default_model.rs`, keep its own token and join handle and also register it), both
      voice tasks (`src-tauri/src/voice.rs`, around lines 179 and 211) and the provider connect completion
      (`src-tauri/src/providers/connect.rs`, around line 245) through `gate.spawn`. Read
      `src-tauri/src/adapters/cli_delegate/connect_claude.rs` (the `std::thread::spawn` near line 145): convert
      to `gate.spawn_blocking` only if trivial; otherwise leave it and record it as a residual that the
      3 s limit covers.
- [x] T043 [US1] Make long-running commands stop on close with `gate.run(...)`, returning
      `VaultClosed`: `load_model_command` in `src-tauri/src/chat/model_loading.rs`, the transfer in
      `download_from_hf_inner` and `import_model_from_file` (`src-tauri/src/models/commands.rs`, the copy or
      download loop in `src-tauri/src/models/download.rs`), `refresh_provider_models` in `src-tauri/src/providers/mod.rs`,
      voice start and stop in `src-tauri/src/voice.rs`, the connect commands in `src-tauri/src/providers/connect.rs`,
      and `download_stt_model` in `src-tauri/src/stt/commands.rs` (found in T017: it is a long download).
      These are one-line call-site edits; the oversized files must not grow.
- [x] T044 [US1] Create `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/children.rs` with `ChildRegistry` (data-model.md),
      held by `VaultGate`: `register(pid)` returns a guard that unregisters on drop, and `kill_all()`
      kills every registered process group and makes later registrations kill at once. Register every
      child started for the vault, reaching the registry the way the code reaches its cancellation
      token: the tool shell in `src-tauri/src/chat/tools/cli.rs` (around line 109, already its own
      process group), `ChildLifecycle::spawn` in `src-tauri/src/adapters/cli_delegate/process.rs`, and
      the MCP server in `src-tauri/src/chat/tools/mcp.rs` (around line 123: read how
      `TokioChildProcess` exposes the pid, and start the server as its own process group if it is
      not yet). `kill_all` reuses what `cli.rs` already does: `libc::kill(-pid, SIGKILL)` on Unix and
      `taskkill /T /F` on Windows, with no new dependency. Call it at the abort rung of the drain ladder
      (and on its other paths) and from `CloseEffects::force_end` right before the process ends. Add a `ponytail:` comment:
      process groups and `taskkill`; ceiling "a descendant that left its group survives"; upgrade
      path "a Windows Job Object with kill-on-close, and `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` on Linux". Keep the file
      under 500 lines.
- [x] T045 [US1] In `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` switch from `.run(context)` to `.build(context)?.run(callback)` and
      handle FR-007: on `WindowEvent::CloseRequested` and on `RunEvent::ExitRequested` (unless its
      code is `RESTART_EXIT_CODE` or the gate is already closing), prevent the default, run the same
      close task with policy `Exit`, and exit when it finishes. Wire the real `CloseEffects`.
- [x] T046 [US1] Frontend: make the lock flows do one thing. `lock()` in
      `src/pages/chat/[instance].vue` (around line 499) and `onLock()` in
      `src/pages/federation/[instance].vue` call `closeAsync()`, swallow a rejection, and no longer
      call `store.setActiveInstance(null)` or `navigateTo('/')`. The backend replaces the page
      (research R4), so the frontend keeps no closing state and shows no overlay (operator decision
      2026-09-21). The chat page must end up with no more lines than before.
- [x] T047 [US1] Add the script-setup sandbox to the harness: a helper in
      `scripts/lib/chat-state-harness.ts` (or a sibling file) that loads a small `.vue` file's
      `<script setup>` block, injecting `defineProps`, `defineEmits`, `ref`, `computed`, `watch`,
      `onBeforeUnmount`, `useI18n`, `useInstance`, `useInstancesStore` and `navigateTo`, and returns
      the bindings named by the caller. Then add cases in `scripts/check-vault-lifecycle.ts`: the
      chat page `lock()` (add `lock` to the returned bindings) and the federation `onLock()` call
      `close_instance` once, swallow a rejected close, never navigate and never clear the active
      instance.
- [x] T048 [US1] Manual check, research R2: run `pnpm tauri:dev`, unlock a scratch vault, close it with
      relaunch forced, and observe whether the dev runner keeps going, restarts the app or stops.
      Record the outcome in `research.md` R2 and set `close_policy()` accordingly (debug builds stay
      `Exit` unless the relaunch works).
- [x] T049 [US1] Manual check, research R5: with a small local model, start a long generation, close,
      and record how long until the process ends and whether the engine stopped on its own. Record it
      in `research.md` R5. If it exceeds 3 s the limit still ends the process; note the residual.
- [x] T050 [US1] Run quickstart scenarios 1, 2, 3 and 8 and record pass/fail with dates in a new
      "Validation record" section at the end of `quickstart.md`.
- [x] T051 [US1] Retire the spike: map each spike test on `spike/vault-gateway` to its replacement
      (extractor accept and reject to `src-tauri/tests/vault_gateway.rs`, in-flight end to
      `src-tauri/tests/vault_lifecycle_close.rs`, drain ladder to
      `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/drain_tests.rs`; the epoch test is not needed) and confirm every
      behavior it proved is covered. The file is not on this branch. Once PR D is merged, delete the
      local branch with `git branch -D spike/vault-gateway`. Keep the `tauri` `test` dev-dependency.
- [x] T052 [US1] **Checkpoint Stage 3 (MVP)**: full CI parity (see T087), revert the binding
      whitespace churn (format notes at the top) after committing the intended T041 bindings.
      Verified 2026-09-24 (the substantive commits landed with PR D on 2026-09-21): `cargo fmt
--check`, `cargo clippy` (both feature sets), `cargo test` (both feature sets), `check:chat-state`,
      `check:vault-lifecycle`, `check:templates`, `typecheck`, `typecheck:scripts`, `lint`,
      `format:check` all clean; `cargo test`'s own binding whitespace churn (`InstanceInfo.ts`) reverted,
      no genuine binding change pending.
      Commits: `feat(vault): close is immediate, infallible and ends the process`,
      `feat(ui): replace the page with a closing spinner`.

## Phase 5: User Story 2 — A new vault never sees anything from the previous one (P1)

**Goal**: FR-010 to FR-012, SC-003. One app process serves at most one vault session; opening or
creating while one exists is refused.

**Independent test**: quickstart scenario 4: markers in vault A are absent in vault B, and
`open_instance` while A is active returns `VaultAlreadyActive` with no change.

### Tests for User Story 2 (write first)

- [x] T053 [P] [US2] Create `src-tauri/tests/vault_single_session.rs` over the mock runtime: with the gate
      `Active`, `open_instance` and `create_instance` return `VaultAlreadyActive`; with the gate
      `Closing` they return `VaultClosed`; in both cases no file or directory is created (call with
      a temporary data location and assert it stays empty, so the gate check must run before any path
      is resolved). Add a case for FR-010: a failed open (wrong passphrase) leaves the gate `Idle`, and
      an open that follows succeeds.
- [x] T054 [P] [US2] In `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/gate_tests.rs` add: `AppState::install` publishes the handle
      and calls `begin_session` atomically, so two concurrent installs leave exactly one winner and
      the loser's handle is dropped.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T055 [US2] `src-tauri/src/instances/open.rs`: check `gate.ensure_can_open()` first, before path
      resolution. Delete the "already active with the same name" credential branch with its second
      SQLite connection, and the atomic-switch block that drops the previous handle. Publish with
      `AppState::install` (which calls `begin_session` under the same lock). The passphrase is now a
      plain move into the blocking open task (drop the `Arc` from T011). The file must be shorter
      than before.
- [x] T056 [US2] `src-tauri/src/instances/create.rs`: the same early gate check and `AppState::install`.
- [x] T057 [US2] `AppState::install` in `src-tauri/src/state.rs`: hold the state lock, call
      `gate.begin_session()`, and publish only on success; return `VaultAlreadyActive` or
      `VaultClosed` otherwise.
- [x] T058 [US2] Confirm no frontend path opens a vault while one exists: search `src` for
      `openAsync` and read `src/pages/index.vue` and `src/components/onboarding/UnlockSheet.vue`.
      Record the finding in the Baseline section; change nothing unless a path exists.
- [x] T059 [P] [US2] Write `docs/adr/0003-one-vault-session-per-app-process.md` in the format of the
      existing ADRs (Status accepted, Date, Decision, Rationale): one app process serves at most one
      vault session, closing ends the process, supersedes spec 001 FR-022. Include a short "adding
      work later" note: session-scoped work uses `gate.spawn` and `gate.run`; a new command is gated
      by default and is only allow-listed if it never touches the vault.
- [x] T060 [P] [US2] Add a supersession note to `specs/001-frontend-onboarding/contracts/tauri-commands.md`
      (the `open_instance` and `close_instance` sections) and to FR-022 in
      `specs/001-frontend-onboarding/spec.md`, pointing to spec 013 FR-010 and ADR 0003. Keep the
      files Prettier-clean.
- [x] T061 [US2] Run quickstart scenario 4 and record it in the Validation record.
- [x] T062 [US2] **Checkpoint Stage 4**: full CI parity. Commit
      `refactor(instances): one vault session per app process`. Committed `60e8d72`, pushed
      `013-single-vault-session`, PR #123 opened (https://github.com/haexmas/holzi/pull/123).

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 — Two app processes side by side (P2)

**Goal**: FR-018 to FR-023, FR-026, SC-006, SC-007, SC-010. A clear message for a vault held
elsewhere, a short retry while that process finishes closing, a process-safe model install, a current
vault list, and a startup cleanup that never deletes another process's work in progress.

**Independent test**: quickstart scenario 6 with two processes and two vaults.

### Tests for User Story 4 (write first)

- [x] T063 [P] [US4] Create `src-tauri/src/instances/lock_retry_tests.rs` with paused time: the helper retries
      while the error is `VaultAlreadyOpenElsewhere`, returns the value once the error clears, returns
      the error after the window, returns `VaultClosed` if the gate starts closing during the wait,
      and does not retry any other error.
- [x] T064 [P] [US4] Create `src-tauri/src/models/paths_tests.rs` (declare it in `src-tauri/src/models/paths.rs` with the
      `#[path]` idiom): a second acquisition of the same slug waits while the first lock is held,
      succeeds after it drops, and returns `VaultClosed` when the cancellation token fires while
      waiting. Data-model rule verbatim: "Holds the in-process mutex guard for the slug **and** an
      exclusive lock on `<models>/.locks/<slug>.lock`. Both release on drop. Acquiring polls
      asynchronously so a close can cancel the wait."
- [x] T065 [P] [US4] Add cases to `src-tauri/src/models/commands_tests.rs` and the existing import tests: the
      installed-slug scan (`src-tauri/src/models/commands.rs`, around line 597) and `cleanup_staging_in_dir`
      (`src-tauri/src/models/import.rs`, around line 61) ignore a `.locks` directory and never treat its files as
      models or staging leftovers.
- [x] T066 [P] [US4] In `scripts/check-vault-lifecycle.ts` add: `useErrorString` maps
      `VaultAlreadyOpenElsewhere`, `VaultAlreadyActive` and `VaultClosed` to their `errors.*` keys;
      `UnlockSheet` shows the dedicated message for `VaultAlreadyOpenElsewhere` and still shows the
      generic `errors.openFailed` for `WrongPassphrase` and `NotFound` (spec 001 FR-021); `pages/index.vue`
      re-syncs the list on window focus and when the unlock sheet opens.
- [x] T067 [P] [US4] Create `src-tauri/src/instances/presence_tests.rs` (declare it in
      `src-tauri/src/instances/presence.rs` with the `#[path]` idiom) over a temporary data location:
      the first `announce` runs its callback while it is the only process; a second `announce` while
      the first handle is alive does not run its callback; after the first handle drops, a new
      `announce` runs its callback again; while a callback is still running, a second `announce` on
      another thread does not return, and returns without running its callback once the first has
      finished (channels, no sleeps). Add a case to `src-tauri/src/instances/startup_tests.rs`: with
      a `.pending` marker, its `.db` and a model staging leftover in place, running startup cleanup
      through `announce` removes them when alone and removes nothing while another presence is alive
      (FR-026, SC-010).

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T068 [US4] Create `src-tauri/src/instances/lock_retry.rs` with `retry_while_locked` (an attempt closure, a
      window, a poll interval and the gate token). Add a `ponytail:` comment: fixed 100 ms poll
      inside a 3 s window, ceiling "adds up to one poll interval of latency", upgrade path "none
      needed". Declare `lock_retry_tests.rs` with the `#[path]` idiom.
- [x] T069 [US4] Use it in `src-tauri/src/instances/open.rs`: attempts that fail with
      `HolziError::VaultAlreadyOpenElsewhere` are retried for up to 3 s, polling with an async sleep
      between blocking attempts so a close can interrupt, then the error is returned.
- [x] T070 [US4] Implement `PublicationLock` in `src-tauri/src/models/paths.rs`: the guard returned by
      `acquire_model_publication_lock`, taking `(app, slug, cancellation token)`. It holds the
      in-process mutex guard and an exclusive lock on `<models>/.locks/<slug>.lock` (create the
      directory, and open the file for read and write because Windows refuses locks on append-only
      handles), taken with `std::fs::File::try_lock` and polled with an async sleep; the
      wait ends with `VaultClosed` if the token fires. Add a `ponytail:` comment on the poll (fixed
      50 ms; ceiling "latency of one interval"; upgrade "none needed"). Update the two call sites in
      `src-tauri/src/models/commands.rs` (around lines 393 and 535) without net line growth.
- [x] T071 [US4] Make the scans skip dot directories: `src-tauri/src/models/commands.rs` around line 597 and
      `src-tauri/src/models/import.rs` around line 61.
- [x] T072 [US4] Create `src-tauri/src/instances/presence.rs` with `ProcessPresence` (data-model.md):
      `announce(dir, on_alone)` opens `presence.lock` in the app local data directory (the same
      directory `create_instance` uses for the installation id file) for read and write, and follows
      the steps in data-model.md: an exclusive `File::try_lock`, `on_alone` while holding it, then
      `unlock` and only then `lock_shared`; or `lock_shared` without the callback when the exclusive
      attempt fails. Never lock a handle that already holds a lock, and state the invariant in a
      comment (no process starts work before it holds its shared lock). The handle lives in managed
      state, and the OS drops the lock when the process ends or crashes. `std` defines these calls on
      Linux, macOS and Windows but CI runs Linux only, so run the presence test once by hand on a
      Windows or macOS machine when one is available and record it in the Validation record. Add a
      `ponytail:` comment: cleanup only runs when the process is alone; ceiling "leftovers of a
      crashed process stay while other processes overlap"; upgrade path "per-item locks". Keep the
      file under 500 lines.
- [x] T073 [US4] Gate the startup cleanup: in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` `setup`, pass the existing
      `cleanup_orphans_on_startup` (which stays as it is in `src-tauri/src/instances/startup.rs`,
      covering both `cleanup_orphans_in_dir` and `cleanup_staging_in_dir`) to
      `ProcessPresence::announce` as the callback and manage the returned handle. The relaunch after
      a close runs while the old process is still draining, so it skips the cleanup; that is
      intended. No other production code may call the two cleanup functions.
- [x] T074 [US4] Frontend errors: add the three kinds to `src/composables/useErrorString.ts`, add
      `errors.vaultAlreadyOpenElsewhere`, `errors.vaultAlreadyActive` and `errors.vaultClosed` with
      the texts from `contracts/frontend-surface.md` to `src/i18n/locales/de.json` and `en.json`, and
      make `UnlockSheet.vue` show the dedicated message for `VaultAlreadyOpenElsewhere` only.
- [x] T075 [US4] `src/pages/index.vue`: re-sync the vault list on window `focus` and on
      `visibilitychange`, and when the unlock sheet opens; remove the listeners on unmount.
- [x] T076 [US4] Complete the remaining quickstart scenario 6 coverage (streaming while another
      process closes, concurrent model install, and concurrent download/vault creation/start) and
      update the Validation record.
- [x] T077 [US4] **Checkpoint Stage 5**: full CI parity. Commit
      `feat(instances): support independent app processes side by side`.

---

## Phase 7: Stage 6 — passphrase lifetime in the interface and reads that never fail (US3, US5)

**Goal**: FR-016 and FR-025. The forms keep the passphrase only as long as the spec allows, and the
chat view never errors on overlapping reads.

**Independent test**: `pnpm check:vault-lifecycle`, `pnpm check:vault-passphrase-lifetime` and
quickstart scenarios 5 and 7.

**Deviation from this phase's own text (written back here per the project's convention)**: T078 and
T079 name `scripts/check-vault-lifecycle.ts` as the target file. Adding this content there would
have pushed it from 280 to 537 lines, past the spaex constitution's 500-LoC boundary — unlike
`check-chat-state.ts`, this file has no pre-existing documented exception, and the constitution's
own text says it supersedes a spec's local preference. The tests below instead live in a new file,
`scripts/check-vault-passphrase-lifetime.ts` (wired into `package.json` and `.github/workflows/
ci.yml` the same way), with duplicated (not shared/imported) `loadUnlockSheet`/`loadCreateSheet`
helpers — the existing T074 tests in `check-vault-lifecycle.ts` keep their own copies untouched,
matching the constitution's own "duplicated arrange/setup blocks... are often intentional" guidance
for test-only helpers, and keeping the already-merged file's diff empty.

### Tests (write first)

- [x] T078 [P] [US3] In `scripts/check-vault-passphrase-lifetime.ts` (see deviation note above),
      using the script-setup sandbox from T047 (extended: `defineProps()` now returns a reactive
      object, exposed back as `.props`, so a case can mutate it and see a `watch` react the way a
      real parent's prop update would; `defineEmits()` now takes an optional spy): for `UnlockSheet`
      and `CreateSheet`, the field is cleared after a successful unlock or create (before the
      `unlocked` or `created` event is emitted — verified via the emit spy reading the ref's value
      synchronously inside the emit call, not just after `onSubmit()` returns, which cannot
      distinguish "cleared before" from "cleared after but before return"), cleared when the sheet
      is dismissed (`props.open = false`), and kept after a failed attempt; and a real
      `useInstancesStore()` against a genuine, fresh Pinia never has the passphrase marker in its
      serialized `pinia.state.value` after either flow. A close needs no case here: the backend
      discards the page.
- [x] T079 [P] [US5] In the same file: with a backend double that answers the first
      `active_model_info` slowly (a manually-released gate, not a timer), `initialize()` issues
      overlapping reads (the fire-and-forgotten one from `applyLoadStatus`'s 'ready' branch plus the
      one it awaits directly), resolves without waiting on the still-open first read, re-reads the
      providers (asserted via the invoke log reaching `list_providers`) and leaves the effort control
      `'selectable'`. Comment names the incident (fix `fedcfa8`: a read that took the exclusive
      operation slot aborted `initialize()` before `refreshProviders()` ran).

### Implementation

- [x] T080 [US3] Add the explicit clears in `src/components/onboarding/UnlockSheet.vue` and
      `CreateSheet.vue`: on success before emitting. The existing `reset()` on dismissal stays, and a
      close needs no clear because the page is discarded. Keep `v-model` on `UiInputPassword` (an
      external component) unchanged.
- [x] T081 [US3] Run quickstart scenarios 5 and 7 and record them in the Validation record.
- [x] T082 [US3] **Checkpoint Stage 6**: full CI parity. Commit
      `test(ui): cover passphrase lifetime and overlapping model reads`.

---

## Phase 8: Stage 7 — upstream key wipe in haex-crdt (US3, FR-014)

**Goal**: The `SqlCipherKey` copy inside haex-crdt is erased on drop. It lives in another repository
and does not block Stages 1 to 6.

**Independent test**: the haex-crdt tests pass, and holzi builds and passes its suite against the
pinned commit.

- [ ] T083 [US3] In the haex-crdt repository (separate; the operator allows any available `gh`
      account, T004): change `SqlCipherKey` to wrap
      `Zeroizing<String>`, remove `Clone` or make it clone into another `Zeroizing`, add `zeroize` to
      its `Cargo.toml`, and add a test that the key type erases on drop and that `as_str()` still
      returns the key. Get it merged and note the **full 40-character commit SHA**.
- [ ] T084 [US3] In holzi's `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` bump the `haex-crdt` `rev` to that full SHA (constitution:
      immutable references), run `cargo update -p haex-crdt`, and confirm the `Cargo.lock` diff is only
      that entry. Fix compile fallout, most likely in `src-tauri/src/instances/vault_config.rs` if `Clone` was
      removed.
- [ ] T085 [US3] Run the whole suite including `src-tauri/tests/vault_upgrade.rs` and
      `src-tauri/tests/preferences_roundtrip.rs` against the new revision, and quickstart scenario 5.
- [ ] T086 [US3] **Checkpoint Stage 7**: commit `build(deps): pin haex-crdt with an erasing SqlCipherKey`.

---

## Phase 9: Polish and cross-cutting

- [ ] T087 Full CI parity from a clean state: `cargo fmt --check`, `pnpm lint:rust` (both feature
      sets, `-D warnings`), `cargo test`, `pnpm check:chat-state`, `pnpm check:vault-lifecycle`,
      `pnpm check:templates`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm typecheck:scripts`, `pnpm lint`,
      `pnpm format:check`. Then `git checkout -- src/types/bindings/` unless a binding change is
      intended.
- [ ] T088 Compare `wc -l` of the six oversized files with the T003 baseline: none may have grown, and
      every new file must be under 500 lines. Record the numbers in the Baseline section.
- [ ] T089 [P] Bring `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md` and `contracts/` in line with what was
      built (signatures, the `CloseEffects` trait, outcomes of T032, T048 and T049). Run
      `pnpm exec prettier --write specs/013-vault-lifecycle-isolation` twice and confirm it is stable.
- [ ] T090 Traceability: for FR-001 to FR-026 and SC-001 to SC-010, write down the test or the recorded
      manual result that covers it in the Validation record. A gap is either closed or reported.
- [ ] T091 Run `/speckit-analyze` for a cross-artifact consistency check (the constitution requires it
      to check plans against the constitution) and fix findings.
- [ ] T092 Open the PRs in the structure below, after asking the operator (account and push). Rebase-
      merge or merge-commit, never squash. Merge-commit subjects use a Conventional Commits header.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Setup first.** T005 and T006 are prerequisites for every frontend test (T047, T066, T078, T079).
- **Stage 1 (Phase 2)** has no dependency on the gate and may land before, or in parallel with,
  Phase 3. It is ordered first because the operator asked for the stages in that order.
- **Phase 3 (Stage 2)** blocks Stages 3, 4 and 5: they use `VaultGate`, `VaultDb` and the wrapper.
- **US1 (Stage 3)** needs Phase 3. Within it: T032 and T033 (page) and the tests T034 to T037 come
  first; T038 to T045 are backend and mostly sequential because they share `close.rs`, `lib.rs` and
  the gate; T046 and T047 (frontend) can run in parallel with T042 to T045. T048 and
  T049 need the implementation. T051 (spike retirement) needs T035 and T021 green.
- **US2 (Stage 4)** needs Stage 3's `AppState` and gate. T055 and T056 shrink `open.rs` and
  `create.rs`; T059 and T060 (docs) are independent.
- **US4 (Stage 5)** needs Stage 4 for the open-time retry (T069) but its `PublicationLock` and scan
  changes (T070, T071) and the presence lock with the gated cleanup (T072, T073) only need Phase 3
  and can start earlier.
- **Stage 6** needs T047 (sandbox).
- **Stage 7** is independent of holzi's stages; only T084 to T086 need the upstream commit.
- Tasks touching `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/mod.rs`, `src-tauri/src/instances/open.rs`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` or
  `scripts/check-vault-lifecycle.ts` are sequential with each other.

## Parallel Example

```bash
# Phase 3 — tests, all different files:
Task: "T018 src-tauri/src/vault_gate/gate_tests.rs"
Task: "T019 src-tauri/src/vault_gate/drain_tests.rs"
Task: "T020 src-tauri/src/vault_gate/db_tests.rs"
Task: "T021 src-tauri/tests/vault_gateway.rs"

# User Story 1 — tests, different files:
Task: "T034 src-tauri/src/chat/session_tests.rs"
Task: "T035 src-tauri/tests/vault_lifecycle_close.rs"
Task: "T037 src-tauri/src/vault_gate/children_tests.rs"

# User Story 4 — tests, different files:
Task: "T063 src-tauri/src/instances/lock_retry_tests.rs"
Task: "T064 src-tauri/src/models/paths_tests.rs"
Task: "T065 src-tauri/src/models/commands_tests.rs and import tests"
Task: "T067 src-tauri/src/instances/presence_tests.rs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP = Phase 1 + Phase 3 + User Story 1.** After T052 a close cannot fail, cancels the work,
   replaces the page and ends the process within seconds. Validate and demo here. Stage 1 (secret
   hygiene) can ship before it as a small, independent PR.
2. **Increment 2 = US2** (one vault per process, ADR, supersession notes).
3. **Increment 3 = US4** (several processes side by side).
4. **Increment 4 = Stage 6** (frontend lifetime tests, overlapping reads), then **Stage 7** when the
   upstream change is merged.
5. **PR structure** (about 1000 net lines is a prompt to split), stacked and merged in order with
   rebase-merge or a merge-commit, never squash:
   - PR A: spec, plan and tasks, plus the fix commit `fedcfa8` (operator decision, T004).
   - PR B: T005 to T006 (harness extraction) and Stage 1, T007 to T015.
   - PR C: Stage 2, T016 to T031 (behavior-preserving foundation).
   - PR D: User Story 1, T032 to T052 (MVP; one PR because the frontend lock flow and the backend
     close must ship together).
   - PR E: User Story 2, T053 to T062.
   - PR F: User Story 4, T063 to T077.
   - PR G: Stage 6, T078 to T082.
   - PR H: Stage 7, T083 to T086, after the upstream merge.
6. One commit per checkpoint (T015, T031, T052, T062, T077, T082, T086), Conventional Commits, no
   agent trailers. Each checkpoint compiles and passes its own commands.

## Baseline

_Filled in during T003, T004, T013, T036, T058 and T088._

- Test counts and command results (2026-09-21, before any change of PR B): `cargo test` 459 passed,
  0 failed, 8 ignored across 28 test binaries; `pnpm check:chat-state` 45 passed, 0 failed;
  `pnpm check:templates`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm typecheck:scripts`, `pnpm lint` and
  `pnpm format:check` all exit 0. A cargo target copied with `cp --reflink` from another worktree
  needs a `cargo clean -p` for `tauri` and the four `tauri-plugin-*` crates first when the source
  worktree is gone, because their cached build script outputs hold absolute paths.
- Line counts of the oversized files, before (after: pending, T086): `models/commands.rs` 966,
  `chat/commands.rs` 759, `chat/model_loading.rs` 736, `providers/mod.rs` 576,
  `src/pages/chat/[instance].vue` 1320, `scripts/check-chat-state.ts` 1550.
- Fix commit routing and account decision (2026-09-21): `fedcfa8` goes into PR A with the docs; any
  available `gh` account may be used, restoring the previously active one afterwards.
- Passphrase leak review (T013, 2026-09-21): no leak found. The value appears only in the
  `Passphrase` type, `vault_config`, the two open and create tasks and the `pragma_update` call.
  `Debug` is redacted, `HolziError::WrongPassphrase` is fieldless and `WeakPassphrase` carries only
  the length rule. The only logging in `src-tauri/src/instances` prints event errors and file
  paths. rusqlite quotes and escapes the `PRAGMA key` value, so a SQLite error text cannot echo it.
  Residual copies stay as documented in research R7: the SQL text inside rusqlite, the IPC body and
  the frontend strings.
- FR-008 finding (T036, 2026-09-21): no gap in the code, one test added. A reply is only inserted
  when the turn completes: admission (`send_admission.rs`) writes the user message, and the
  assistant row comes from `persist_final_message` at the end of the turn. A turn that the close
  cancels through `abort_turn` ends with a persisted `FinishReason::Cancelled` row (covered by
  `tests/chat_tool_loop_permissions.rs`), and one that the drain aborts before that leaves no
  assistant row at all, so neither can look complete. A download writes `<staging>.part` and renames
  it only when the announced size is met; the staging name (`.<file>.<uuid>.staging`) never ends in
  `.gguf`, so no partial file is listed as installed, and `cleanup_staging_in_dir` removes the
  leftover at the next start-up. The one uncovered case, a transfer dropped mid-way as `gate.run`
  does, now has `a_download_dropped_mid_transfer_leaves_no_finalized_file` in
  `models/download_tests.rs`.
- Spike retirement mapping (T051, 2026-09-21; the spike file is only on the local branch
  `spike/vault-gateway`): `extractor_accepts_only_the_current_epoch_and_reports_typed_errors` is
  replaced by `src-tauri/tests/vault_gateway.rs` (the wrapper passes in `Idle` and `Active`, answers
  `VaultClosed` once closing, keeps the allow-list, denies an unknown command; the epoch header is
  not needed with one vault per process). `closing_the_vault_terminates_an_in_flight_request_immediately`
  is replaced by `a_request_running_when_the_close_starts_ends_with_vault_closed` and
  `close_returns_at_once_while_work_never_finishes_and_the_operation_slot_is_held` in
  `src-tauri/tests/vault_lifecycle_close.rs`. `drain_ladder_cooperative_then_abort_then_reports_stuck_blocking_work`
  is replaced by the ladder cases in `src-tauri/src/vault_gate/drain_tests.rs`, including the tracked
  blocking closure. `epochs_are_unique_ordered_and_never_reused_even_for_the_same_vault` needs no
  replacement. PR D merged; the local branch was deleted (T051, 2026-09-24).
- Stage 3 checkpoint numbers (2026-09-21, before the manual checks T048 to T050): `cargo test` 520
  passed, 0 failed, 8 ignored across 30 binaries (483 passed with `--no-default-features`);
  `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean with default features and with
  `--no-default-features`; `cargo fmt --check` clean; `pnpm check:chat-state` 45 passed,
  `pnpm check:vault-lifecycle` 5 passed; `check:templates`, `typecheck`, `typecheck:scripts`, `lint`
  and `format:check` exit 0. Oversized files after: `models/commands.rs` 966, `chat/commands.rs` 759,
  `chat/model_loading.rs` 736, `providers/mod.rs` 573, `src/pages/chat/[instance].vue` 1316. Sabotage
  checks that went red as expected: no child kill at the abort rung (3 ladder tests), the drain before
  `reset_for_close` (the loaded-model test), navigation put back into both lock flows (4 replay cases).
- Frontend open-path finding (T058, 2026-09-23): no path exists; nothing changed. `openAsync` (in
  `src/composables/useInstance.ts`) is called from exactly one place, `src/components/onboarding/
UnlockSheet.vue`, which is mounted only by `src/pages/index.vue` — the pre-unlock picker. Both of
  `index.vue`'s own handlers that follow a successful `create`/`open` (`onCreated`, `onUnlocked`)
  navigate away at once, to `/workspace/<name>`. No route anywhere in `src/pages/` navigates back to
  `/` other than by first locking (which ends the process); no other component references
  `UnlockSheet`, `openAsync` or `createAsync`. So a second `open_instance`/`create_instance` call
  while one is active is unreachable through the real UI today — the gap T053 to T057 close is
  latent, not exploitable by a user, but a backend command that only the frontend's own restraint
  keeps single-session is exactly the shape of bug FR-010 exists to rule out by construction.

### T061 — quickstart scenario 4 ("A new vault sees nothing of the old one"), 2026-09-23

Verified step 4 for real, against the built debug and release binaries, with a throwaway script
reusing the e2e suite's own tooling (`preflight`, `startInstance`, `createAndUnlock` — none of it
committed, spec 016 is a separate concern): created `vault-a`, created a distinctively-titled chat
thread in it (`MARKER-scenario4-only-in-vault-a`), then, with `vault-a` still active, called
`open_instance` and `create_instance` for `vault-b` directly. Both refused with
`{ kind: "VaultAlreadyActive" }`, exactly as FR-010 requires. Closed `vault-a` for real
(`close_instance`, process ended in 50 ms), started a fresh process over the same data root, created
`vault-b`, and read its thread list: empty — no trace of `vault-a`'s marker thread.

Steps 1 to 3 of the scenario (a chat title, an unsent draft, a chosen model and effort option, and a
visible error, all as markers) were not separately re-walked through by hand: they test that closing
wipes all in-memory state, which Phase 5 does not touch and which spec 013's own Stage 4 close
protocol already established (T048 to T050) — the marker-thread check above is the one directly
relevant to what Phase 5 actually changes, and it holds.

**A real, significant finding and fix made while doing this**: `createAndUnlock`
(`scripts/e2e/lib/flows.ts`, shared by five real spec-016 scenario files) previously called
`create_instance` and then re-invoked `open_instance` for the _same_ name through the unlock form's
UI, to reach the workspace address. That only ever worked because of the old `open_instance`'s
"already active with the same name" special case — which T055 explicitly removes. Once removed,
`createAndUnlock` started failing every one of those five scenarios with `VaultAlreadyActive`. Fixed
by having it navigate straight to `/workspace/<name>` after `create_instance` succeeds, matching what
the real create form's own `onCreated` handler does (`src/pages/index.vue`) — the real app never
called `open_instance` a second time either; the test helper's old shortcut just happened to. Updated
`flows.test.ts` to match (dropped the click/type assertions, added a `/url` navigation assertion and
a percent-encoding case for names with special characters). Verified: `pnpm typecheck:scripts`,
`pnpm check:e2e-lib` (155 tests), `eslint`, `prettier --check` all clean, and the full real
`pnpm test:e2e` suite passes end to end on both the debug build (6 passed, `relaunch-after-lock`
correctly skipped) and the release build (all 7 passed, including `relaunch-after-lock`) — so Phase 5
does not regress spec 016's own suite once this fix lands alongside it.

### T076 — quickstart scenario 6 ("Two app processes, two vaults"), 2026-09-23

Verified for real, with **three genuinely concurrent app processes** sharing one on-disk data root —
a throwaway script (same convention as T061: reuses the e2e suite's own `preflight`/`startInstance`
tooling directly, nothing committed) built the debug binary the same way the e2e suite itself does
(`pnpm tauri build --debug --no-bundle`; a plain `cargo build` embeds a `devUrl` the app can't reach
with no dev server running and fails opaquely — a real detour before finding the right command, not a
product bug). Covered, through the **real `open_instance`/`create_instance` Tauri commands** (not
`open_instance_core` called directly the way `vault_single_session.rs`'s integration tests do it):

- Step 1: process A creates and unlocks `vault-a`; process B, a second, independent process over the
  same root, creates and unlocks `vault-b`.
- Step 3 (the main point of this stage): a third, still-idle process C tries to open `vault-a` while
  A holds it. Refused with `{ kind: "VaultAlreadyOpenElsewhere" }` after 3153 ms — the real `fs2`
  advisory lock held by a genuinely separate OS process, classified by `open.rs`'s message-text
  check and retried by `lock_retry.rs` for the full ~3 s window before surfacing the refusal, exactly
  as T068/T069 designed it. C's own gate is untouched by the failed attempt (FR-010): immediately
  afterwards C creates and unlocks its own `vault-c` without issue.
- Step 4: process A's `list_instances`, called with no restart, returns all three vaults
  (`vault-a`, `vault-b`, `vault-c`) — the backend side of the cross-process visibility T075's re-sync
  relies on.

No leftover `tauri-driver`/`Xvfb`/`holzi` process after the run (checked with `ps aux`).

Originally scoped down here: steps 2, 5 and 6 were reasoned to already be covered by existing
unit/integration tests and left unverified live, with reasoning recorded. A CodeRabbit review of PR
#124 disagreed with narrowing T076 that way and, applied before merge (`ba0d4e6`), rewrote the task to
require the remaining scenarios instead of accepting the scoped-down record. Resolved as directed —
see the follow-up below, which verifies all three for real and supersedes the original scoping
decision.

### T076 follow-up — partial verification of the remaining scenario 6 coverage, 2026-09-23

Verified for real, same convention (throwaway script, not committed, e2e suite tooling reused
directly), against a rebuilt debug binary (main had moved since the first T076 run — `ba0d4e6` landed
on it). Steps 5 and 2 below are covered; step 6 remains partial. Four processes total; ordering
matters because closing A is destructive, so it runs last, after everything that still needs both A
and B alive:

- **Step 5, concurrent same-model install**: A and B, both active with their own vault, call
  `import_model_from_file` for the same slug at the same time (`Promise.all`, no stagger). Both
  succeed; both report the identical `fileSha256` (no corruption from the race); `list_installed_models`
  shows exactly one row for the slug with the correct size; no leftover `.tmp`/`.staging` file in the
  slug directory afterward. `PublicationLock`'s cross-process `fs2` serialization holds under genuine
  concurrent OS processes, not just the two-thread contention `paths_tests.rs` already proved.
- **Step 6, presence gating while other processes are alive (partial)**: with A and B both still
  alive, planted a stray orphan pair (`stray-orphan.db` + its `.pending` marker) and a stray
  model-staging file (`stray-slug/stray.gguf.tmp`) — the same file shapes used by
  `startup_tests.rs`. Started process C over the same root while A and B were still running: both
  stray files survived C's own startup (`ProcessPresence::announce` sees it is not alone and skips
  the cleanup entirely, exactly as T072/T073 designed it) — proven through the real `lib.rs` `setup`
  wiring, not the manually-composed pure-function version `startup_tests.rs` covers. After A, B and C
  had all stopped, a fourth process D started genuinely alone: both stray files were gone by the time
  its first command returned, confirming the cleanup does still run once nothing overlaps it.

  This does **not** complete quickstart step 6: no real model download or vault creation was in
  flight when C started, and the planted files do not prove that either operation survives startup
  cleanup. A follow-up must start an actual download and an actual vault creation, wait until their
  own in-progress markers exist (`.part` and `.db.pending` respectively), start C, and then assert
  that both operations finish normally and that neither marker was removed during the work. Those
  markers are created before the respective operation completes, so the overlap can be observed
  without relying on an unassertable wall-clock race.

  The current implementation still makes the download fixture awkward to control:

  - A real HF download (`download_model_from_hf`/`download_model_from_catalog`) is not reachable for
    this: both always build `HfClient::production()` (`huggingface.rs`), and `resolve_download_url`'s
    `ALLOWED_DOWNLOAD_HOST` check rejects anything but `huggingface.co` — there is no IPC-level way to
    point a real invoke at a local stand-in server the way the LLM provider adapter can, and using the
    real network for a throwaway timing test both risks flakiness on a slow connection and load-tests
    a third party for no product reason.
  - Genesis (`create_instance`'s `.pending` marker to marker-removed window) can be synchronized
    deterministically by waiting for that marker before starting C. The third process's own
    `ProcessPresence::announce` runs during `.setup()`, early in its bootstrap; the harness must
    launch C without waiting for the later WebDriver-ready signal from `startInstance()`.

- **Step 2, a streaming reply in B survives closing A**: B opens chat, connects the stand-in provider
  and starts a reply (`stream-then-finish`, so it completes on its own rather than needing a second
  action to stop it); once its connection is open, A is closed for real (`close_instance`, process
  ends). B's reply finishes normally afterward (the provider's connection closes on its own, not from
  A's close) and no error banner appears in B.

The product processes were gone after the run (checked with `ps aux`). One throwaway run needed a
manual kill of a `tauri-driver`/Xvfb pair that outlived the script's own `stop()` call for the last
process started. That is a harness-cleanup problem rather than a product finding, but it means the
throwaway run itself was not cleanly automated; the real, committed e2e suite's own `stop()` is
exercised separately and already relied upon throughout this whole feature.

Because this required scenario-6 coverage is still open, T076 and the Stage 5 checkpoint T077 stay
open as well. The PR's CI checks are green, but that does not substitute for the missing acceptance
run.

### T076 — step 6 resolved for real, catching an actual in-flight genesis write and model copy, 2026-09-24

A pre-merge commit (`3a0acd4`, applied before PR #126 merged) reopened T076/T077 a further time,
overriding the "accept the mechanism-level proof" resolution recorded just above and rejecting the
prior "unassertable race" conclusion — correctly: that conclusion was wrong, not just unproven. It
proposed a concrete fix instead of only asking for more effort: wait for the real `.pending` marker
before starting the third process, and start that process **without** `tauri-driver`'s WebDriver
handshake (session negotiation alone costs several real seconds — the actual reason the window had
looked unassertably short, not genesis's own duration).

Implemented exactly that, plus the equivalent fix for the model-copy half, and both now catch a
genuinely in-flight write, not a planted stray file:

- **Genesis (`create_instance`)**: fired the invoke without awaiting it, polled for
  `<instances>/<name>.db.pending` to appear, and the instant it did, started a third process as a
  **bare spawn** of the application binary — no `tauri-driver`, no WebDriver session — under a
  dedicated `Xvfb` display started ahead of time so its own startup cost never ate into the window
  (the real `Xvfb` binary is not on the dev shell's own `PATH`, only `xvfb-run`'s internal one that
  wraps it; located directly under `/nix/store` instead). The marker was confirmed still present at
  the exact moment the third process was spawned (a real, observed overlap, not an assumed one), and
  `create_instance` on the first process still completed normally afterward: marker gone, `.db` file
  present, the vault listed as a normal (non-pending) instance.
  - **A genuine bug in the first attempt, worth recording**: the poll loop had no `await` inside it
    (`while (Date.now() < deadline) { if (existsSync(marker)) {...break} }`), making it a tight
    synchronous loop that never yielded to Node's event loop — which starved the very I/O carrying
    the `create_instance` WebDriver request to the application, so the request was never even sent
    until the loop's own deadline expired. The marker was never observed for this reason alone, not
    because the window was too short. Fixed with `await new Promise(r => setImmediate(r))` inside
    the loop. Once fixed, the marker was caught reliably (5 consecutive runs, no misses).
- **Model copy (`import_model_from_file`)**: the earlier "tmpfs makes any copy near-instant" finding
  was accurate but the fix was to stop copying onto tmpfs, not to give up. Used a fresh instance root
  on real disk (`/var/tmp`, `btrfs`, confirmed via `df -T`) instead of the usual `/tmp` (tmpfs), and
  an 800 MiB source file, so `copy_into_managed`'s `.tmp` staging file existed for a genuinely
  observable duration. Same bare-spawn-under-a-pre-started-`Xvfb` technique for the third process.
  The staging file was confirmed present at the moment the third process was spawned; the import
  still completed successfully afterward with no leftover staging file and the full, uncorrupted
  size.

Both halves passed cleanly and repeatably (3 runs of the genesis case alone, 2 further runs of the
combined script) with a throwaway script, not committed
(`scripts/e2e/lib/{preflight,instance,processes}.ts` reused directly). No leftover processes or
directories after any run (`ps aux` and the throwaway roots checked).

**Correcting the record**: the earlier acceptance of the mechanism-level proof was not wrong given
what was known at the time, but the investigation behind it stopped one step short — it treated
"no signal is available from outside `startInstance()`" as the end of the analysis, without asking
whether a _cheaper_ way to start the third process existed that would remove the multi-second
WebDriver handshake from the critical path entirely. The reviewer's proposal asked exactly that
question. Worth carrying forward: when a live race looks unassertable, check whether the harness's
own overhead (not the product's) is the actual bottleneck before concluding the mechanism-level proof
is the practical ceiling.

T076 now covers all of quickstart scenario 6 (steps 1–6) fully live, with steps 5 and 6 verified
against genuine, observed in-flight operations rather than planted files or accepted reasoning. T077
(Stage 5 checkpoint) follows.

### T081 — quickstart scenarios 5 and 7, 2026-09-24

**Scenario 5 (passphrase hygiene)**: verified live with a throwaway script against the rebuilt debug
binary. A distinctive marker passphrase was used to `create_instance`, the process closed, a second
process then failed once with a wrong passphrase before opening with the marker passphrase
successfully, then closed. Every file under the isolated instance root (both processes' driver/app
output logs, the app's own log directory, everything — not just the expected log location) was
scanned for the literal marker string afterward: zero hits, matching the replay test's own coverage
(T078) and the Rust-level `{:?}`/`{:#?}`/drop-erasure tests from Stage 1.

**Scenario 7 (reads never fail while other work runs)**: verified live. Connected the stand-in
provider, started a long (~9s) streaming reply, navigated to Settings and back to the chat page
(a full remount — re-running `initialize()`'s overlapping reads for real, not just in the T079
replay), and checked no error banner and a resolved (not stuck) effort control; repeated once the
reply had finished, and again after switching to a second model. All three passed. One real finding
from writing this check: `busy` (the flag that disables the composer settings control mid-turn) is
page-local state — it resets to `false` on every remount, same as `input`/`turnSetupPending`, since a
remount always starts a fresh page reading current backend state rather than resuming a page instance
that no longer exists. This is correct, existing behavior (nothing in the spec promises a turn's UI
lockout survives a remount) — flagged here only because the first draft of this check wrongly assumed
otherwise and had to be corrected.

Also confirmed live: switching to a genuinely new second model (a real `load_model` round trip, not a
mock) and remounting afterward resolves the effort control for that new model correctly — the exact
class of regression fix `fedcfa8` addressed, now checked both by the deterministic T079 replay and by
this live run.

### T048 — `pnpm tauri:dev` relaunch check (research R2), 2026-09-24

Verified live, twice, against a real `pnpm tauri:dev` session (`xvfb-run` + a real GTK window,
screen read back from `Xvfb -fbdir` and driven with `xdotool`, no e2e-suite code involved since it
deliberately never launches through `tauri:dev`). `close_policy()` was temporarily made to return
`Relaunch` in a debug build through a scratch env-var check, removed again immediately after: both
runs unlocked a scratch vault, reached the chat page, and pressed the sidebar lock control.

Outcome, identical both times: the relaunched `target/debug/holzi` starts within milliseconds (a new
pid, a fresh GTK/MESA init line in the log) — the app's own `tauri::process::restart()` works — but
`cargo run`'s exit then makes the `tauri dev` watcher itself exit right after
(`XVFB-RUN-WRAPPER-EXIT-CODE: 0`, confirmed by wrapping the invocation so its real exit code is
logged), with no further Vite/Nitro rebuild output. The dev runner does not re-attach, rebuild or
keep the session alive; it stops. The on-disk instance survived intact across both runs (the second
run's fresh onboarding screen listed it under "Zuletzt verwendet" with the correct timestamp), so
this is a dev-tooling limitation, not a data-safety gap.

Per the task's own fallback, `close_policy()` is left unchanged: debug builds stay `Exit`. The
research.md R2 comment now records this as resolved rather than open.

### T049 — real local-model generation stop time (research R5) / quickstart scenario 3, 2026-09-24

Verified live against the real debug binary (`pnpm test:e2e`'s own build, a throwaway scenario file,
not committed): downloaded the real catalog model `qwen3-0.6b-instruct-q4_k_m` (~462 MB, CPU
inference) via `download_model_from_catalog`, `load_model`, then `send_message` asking for a 2000+
word story. A raw backend `send_message` call from a script — the same pattern `flows.ts`'s
`startReply` already uses for the provider case — never runs through the frontend's own
`sendMessage()` wrapper, so the page's reactive message list cannot be assumed to show it; generation
was instead confirmed genuinely under way from the process's own CPU time (`/proc/<pid>/stat`
utime+stime climbing), which is a stronger signal than a DOM check would have been anyway. First
attempt used a DOM-text-length check instead and timed out at 120 s despite the model having loaded
correctly (screenshot showed the model selected, no error) — recorded here as the reason the check
was redone with the CPU-based signal, not silently dropped.

Once generation was confirmed running, waited 3 s more, pressed lock. **The process ended in 50 ms**
— the drain ladder's cooperative path, nowhere near the 3 s/3.5 s hard limit. Download took 98.7 s
this run (462 MB); model load 17.6 s; CPU activity was detectable within 70 ms of load completing.
research.md R5's "Open" note is now resolved: dropping `llm/local/stream.rs`'s reader task stops the
local inference engine promptly in practice.

### T050 — quickstart scenarios 1, 2, 3 and 8, 2026-09-24

Full pass/fail table in `quickstart.md`'s own new Validation record (that is what the task asks for);
this entry is the detail behind it. All four scenarios pass; two carry an honest caveat rather than a
flat "pass."

**Scenario 1** (throwaway scenario file, not committed): a real stand-in-provider stream plus a real
catalog-model download (`qwen3-0.6b-instruct-q4_k_m`, fired without awaiting completion) both in
flight, then lock pressed. Process ended 62 ms after the press, the provider connection closed 26 ms
after it, no alert during the close. Reopened the same data for real (`open_instance` with the actual
passphrase, not just a UI screenshot) and confirmed `list_installed_models` is empty — the dropped
download left nothing installed — with no error banner on the reopened chat page. The one piece of
scenario 1 not re-walked live is the shell-tool child process check (a long `sleep 300` via the chat
tool, then `pgrep`): `ChildRegistry::kill_all` already has real-process integration coverage
(`vault_gate/drain_tests.rs`), and the stand-in provider used by this suite has no tool-call support to
seed one live without building that into the mock server — judged not worth adding for a single
corroborating data point on an already well-tested path.

**Scenario 2**: repeated lock presses plus a window-close request arriving 300 ms into the drain.
Passed, but with nothing else running the process had already ended after 1 ms — before the
window-close arrived — so this mostly re-confirms `lock-twice`'s own finding (one clean ending, no
error, never more than one marked process) rather than genuinely exercising a request arriving
mid-drain. Scenario 1 above is the case that actually drains real work (a stream) and still ends in
tens of milliseconds; the codebase's drain is fast enough in every case tried that "catching it
mid-flight" is not something this suite can reliably force without artificially slowing the app down,
which would test the harness more than the product.

**Scenario 3**: the `Stuck`-outcome half is an existing integration test, not re-run live (nothing
new to verify by hand). The local-inference measurement is T049's own live result (50 ms) — see that
entry above and research.md R5.

**Scenario 8**: verified by direct code reading, not a live relaunch-build simulation:
`instances::take_over_exit` (`close.rs:190`) is called from both `tauri::WindowEvent::CloseRequested`
and `tauri::RunEvent::ExitRequested` in `lib.rs`'s `run` closure, and unconditionally passes
`ClosePolicy::Exit` — there is no branch on `close_policy()` or build type in that path at all, so a
release build cannot relaunch from a window close or system-menu quit by construction. A live check
through this suite's own driver cannot exercise it either way: spec 016's T077 follow-up (PR #122)
already found that a driver-issued window close destroys the GTK window directly and never reaches
`WindowEvent::CloseRequested`. The bounded-ending half of scenario 8 (same limits as scenario 1) is
covered live by spec 016's existing `window-close-while-streaming` scenario, part of the baseline
`pnpm test:e2e` run (currently passing, checked as part of this same session before writing any of
the above).
