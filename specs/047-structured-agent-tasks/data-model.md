# Data Model: Structured Agent Tasks

## `AgentTaskDefinition`

| Field | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `task` | string | Stable identifier; first value is `paper-note-recognition`. |
| `schemaVersion` | positive integer | Host and extension must agree before execution. |
| `requiredCapabilities` | set | Includes image input, OCR/vision and structured output for the first task. |
| `maxInputBytes` | positive integer | Reject oversized images before a task is created. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | positive integer | Bounded by the host maximum of 180 seconds. |

## `AgentTaskProfile`

| Field | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `profileId` | string | User-visible stable identifier; never a secret. |
| `task` | string | The task this profile is allowed to run. |
| `providerId` | UUID/string | Refers to an existing host provider or the local provider. |
| `modelId` | string | Refers to an installed or cached model row. |
| `harnessId` | string | Identifies the execution harness, not credentials. |
| `mode` | `local \| remote` | Derived from the resolved provider; not blindly trusted from the extension. |
| `destination` | string? | User-readable remote destination; omitted for local mode. |

Profiles are persisted as preferences, not as extension-owned database rows.
Credentials remain in the host's provider storage.

## `AgentTaskRun`

| Field | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `taskId` | opaque string | Unique per run; never accepted from another extension. |
| `extensionId` | UUID | Captured from the authenticated frame session. |
| `frame` | string | The originating frame; completion events are scoped to its extension. |
| `task` | string | Must match a registered task definition. |
| `status` | `consent_required \| running \| completed \| failed \| cancelled` | `consent_required` is pending, terminal states are immutable. |
| `processing` | provenance | Contains actual profile/model/harness/mode, without secrets. |
| `cancel` | cancellation token | In-memory only; frame close and vault close cancel it. |
| `result` | JSON? | Present only after schema validation. |
| `error` | structured error? | User-readable marker without raw provider data or paths. |

## State transitions

```text
start request
  ├─ unsupported/profile unavailable → no run
  ├─ consent required → consent_required → running
  └─ accepted → running → completed
                              ├─ failed
                              └─ cancelled
```

## Validation invariants

- A task run cannot outlive its originating frame or active vault.
- A local profile cannot emit a remote destination or invoke a remote fallback.
- A result is emitted only after the task-specific schema validator succeeds.
- Image bytes and raw model output are not persisted by Holzi after completion.
- Extension-visible errors never include provider credentials, full local paths,
  or unbounded raw model output.
