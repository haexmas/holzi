# Implementation Plan: Unified, Cached Model Capabilities

**Branch**: `012-unified-model-capabilities` | **Date**: 2026-09-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/012-unified-model-capabilities/spec.md`

## Summary

Replace five independently-shaped, uncached mechanisms that decide what a model supports (a curated
effort table, a delegate "always all levels" rule, a model-id reasoning heuristic, a version parser
for adaptive thinking, and a provider-kind attachment rule) with **one persisted capability record
per model** — reasoning control, accepted attachment kinds, and one adapter hint — populated live
from the provider where it exposes capability data (Anthropic API key and the Claude Code delegate
share one code path today), computed locally for built-in models, and read from the cached
`models` row by every caller.

The user's selected reasoning option is a **separate, per-model, per-device preference** owned by the
existing Pinia model store (no second store), validated against the record and never written to the
`models` table.

Approach, in delivery order (each stage compiles and passes tests on its own):

1. **Backend record + storage** — `model_capabilities.rs`, migration `0018`, `ModelRow` column,
   trigger version bump, `AttachmentKind` serde.
2. **Providers populate it** — Anthropic wire mapping (covers the Claude delegate), Codex "not
   determined", local at registration plus a lazy backfill for legacy local rows.
3. **Consumers switch to the record** — `send_message`, `inspect_attachment`, the Anthropic
   serializer; the five legacy mechanisms and `get_effort_levels` are deleted.
4. **Frontend** — behavior-preserving split of the oversized `useModelsStore`, then the reasoning
   preference slice, popover states, page cleanup.
5. **Refresh action** — the per-provider "Refresh models" button (FR-022), which the spec depends on
   and the UI did not have.

Two gaps in the source design were found while verifying against the code and are resolved in
[research.md](research.md): the Anthropic serializer needs an adaptive-vs-manual signal the shared
enum could not carry (R2), and legacy local models would never receive capabilities without a
backfill (R4). A third, the missing UI refresh path, became FR-022 (R9).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.95, edition 2021 (backend, `src-tauri`); TypeScript 5 / Vue 3
Composition API on a Nuxt 4 SPA with Pinia (frontend). Unchanged.

**Primary Dependencies**: None added. Uses `serde`/`serde_json`, `log`, `rusqlite` via `haex_crdt`,
`wiremock` (already a dev-dependency, used by `anthropic_tests.rs`); frontend uses existing
`usePreferences`, `useDevice`, Pinia.

**Storage**: SQLite (CRDT-tracked). One nullable column `models.capabilities_json TEXT`
(migration `0018_models_add_capabilities`, `HOLZI_TRIGGER_VERSION` 9 → 10). The effort preference
uses the existing `preferences` table, device scope, no schema change.

**Testing**: Rust — sibling `*_tests.rs` files and `tests/` integration tests (`cargo test`,
`cargo fmt --check`, `pnpm lint:rust`). Frontend — the established replay harness
`scripts/check-chat-state.ts` (`pnpm check:chat-state`, run in CI) plus `pnpm typecheck`,
`pnpm typecheck:scripts`, `pnpm check:templates`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`. No test runner
is introduced.

**Target Platform**: Desktop (Tauri), unchanged.

**Project Type**: Desktop application, Rust backend + Vue SPA frontend.

**Performance Goals**: No new request on model switch or composer open (SC-005): capabilities ride
the list payloads the store already fetches; the composer reads a `computed`. Provider refresh adds
no extra HTTP call — the listing already returns the capability tree.

**Constraints**: No automatic network refresh at launch (FR-012). Storage must not depend on adapter
behavior (shared leaf module). Async code must not block the executor — the model-row read stays
inside the existing `spawn_blocking` lookup in `send_message`/`inspect_attachment`. No `unwrap`/
`expect` on stored or network data.

**Scale/Scope**: Tens of models per provider; a handful of providers. Backend touch points measured
in [research.md](research.md) R5 (17 files with `ChatRequest` literals, 5 with `ModelRow`, 3 with
`ProviderModel`) — mechanical, compiler-enumerated.

**Post-design re-check**: the design added `useModelInventory`, `useModelIntegrity`,
`useReasoningPreference`, `backfill_local_capabilities` and one adapter-hint field. Each is a
concrete, tested unit justified in research (R2, R4, R7); none is speculative. No new violation.

**Structure Decision**: Existing Rust-backend / Vue-frontend layout is kept. The capability module is
top-level (a shared leaf, like `crate::error`) so `storage/` and `adapters/` share it without
`storage` gaining a behavioral dependency on `adapters`. Frontend helpers are flat composables (the
repository's convention, and the only shape the replay harness loads without changes — research R7).

| `scripts/check-chat-state.ts` grows past its documented ~985-line exception (+ the new cases)         | The store's new behavior can only be tested through this harness — it is the sole frontend test mechanism and CI gate. | Extracting the harness into `scripts/lib/` first (the file header's own split plan) is a separate mechanical refactor of a 985-line file; bundling it would mix a refactor with a behavior change. Header count is updated and the header states a cap: no further cases before extraction (T053); extraction stays a follow-up. |
| `providers/mod.rs` (562 lines) and `useChat.ts` (575 lines) touched with no documented size exception | The feature adds ~4 lines (`compose_model_row`, payload).                                                              | Splitting it here is unrelated scope; instead a header documents the reason and a concrete split plan, satisfying the rule without a drive-by refactor.                                                                                                                                                                          |
