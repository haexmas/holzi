# Specification Quality Checklist: External Bridge für haex-pass-browser

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- One marker remains: FR-033 (whether holzi sets UV after a presence confirmation). The spec
  proposes "never"; the operator decides in `/speckit-clarify` before planning.
- The spec names the wire protocol, method names and error codes of `haex-pass-browser` and
  haex-vault (repository, full revision, path). That is the compatibility contract the feature
  exists for, in the house style of 034, 036 and 048; the requirements stay at the level of
  behaviour otherwise.
- The answers under Clarifications are proposals of the spec, grounded in holzi's grant model
  (034, 017) and haex-vault's behaviour; they await operator confirmation.
- Bookmark sync of the extension runs over the same connection but is out of scope (FR-028).
- Passkeys need two small changes to the extension (origin, longer wait); autofill, TOTP and
  saving work with the pinned revision unchanged (section "Änderungen an haex-pass-browser").
