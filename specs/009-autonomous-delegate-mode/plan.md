# Implementation Plan: Autonomous Delegate Mode

**Branch**: `009-autonomous-delegate-mode` | **Date**: 2026-09-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/009-autonomous-delegate-mode/spec.md`

## Summary

Adds a per-request **Autonomy Mode** (`standard` / `ungated` / `gated-permissive`) to the existing
`cli_delegate` backends (007-cli-delegate), letting Claude Code or Codex run without holzi's live
per-tool-call human approval — either fully ungated (the delegate's own native full-autonomy
mechanism, no bridge) or gated-but-permissive (007's existing approval bridge stays wired and every
call is still recorded, but the response is auto-`allow` unless an operator-configured, persisted
**Deny Rule** matches). Standard (today's shipped, unchanged) stays the default; the new modes never
persist across requests (spec FR-008), Deny Rules do persist device-wide (spec FR-014). No new
backend, no new credential type, no ACP, no circuit-breaker — this is additive to 007's adapters and
approval bridge, not a parallel system.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.77.2, edition 2021 (backend, `src-tauri`), TypeScript 5 (frontend, Nuxt
4 SPA) — unchanged from 007-cli-delegate.
**Primary Dependencies**: No new crates. Reuses `tokio::process` (claude.rs/codex.rs subprocess
spawning, already in place) and `rmcp` 3.3.0's existing `server`+`transport-io` use in
`permission_mcp_server.rs` — unchanged for the `gated-permissive` mode since it is the exact same
bridge wiring as 007's shipped default, only the decision function changes (see Data Model). The
`ungated` mode needs no bridge process at all for Claude Code (its `--mcp-config`/
`--permission-prompt-tool` args are simply omitted) and no schema/library change for Codex (the
existing `thread/start` JSON-RPC call already accepts the fields needed — see below).
**Storage**: SQLite via SQLCipher through haex-crdt. Planned additive migration
`0017_chat_messages_add_autonomy_mode` adds `chat_messages.autonomy_mode TEXT NULL` so every delegate
turn can record its mode independently of `tool_source`. The existing generic `preferences` table
(`storage/preferences.rs`) needs no schema change; it gains one new device-scoped preference key,
`cli_delegate.deny_rules` (JSON array of category identifiers, e.g.
`["workspace_escape","network_access","credential_paths"]`), read/written through the existing
generic `get_pref`/`set_pref` Tauri commands exactly like `chat.permission_mode` is today
(`preferences_commands.rs:59-136`). The selected mode travels as a per-request field on
`ChatRequest` and is never persisted as a preference or carried into the next request (spec FR-008);
only the mode actually used is recorded on that request's message rows for audit/history.
**Testing**: `cargo test --lib` / `cargo test --test <name>`; new tests in sibling `*_tests.rs` files
(repo convention, no inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`, no exception found anywhere in the codebase).
`pnpm typecheck` for the new composer control. Live-CLI verification spikes (flag/schema behavior)
already run during the 2026-09-17 design session — see `docs/plans/2026-09-17-autonomous-delegate-mode-design.md`
and [research.md](research.md) §1-2 — are not repeated as automated tests (they test vendor CLI
behavior, not holzi's own code) but their _results_ are hard-coded as the two vendor branches below.
**Target Platform**: Desktop only — unchanged from 007-cli-delegate (spec FR-012); no new
mobile-adjacent code path.
**Performance Goals**: Stopping an autonomous delegate response terminates the subprocess within the
same short window 007's existing kill path already achieves (spec SC-005) — no new, independent
target; `ungated` mode has strictly _less_ per-call overhead than `standard`/`gated-permissive`
(no bridge round-trip), not a regression risk.
**Constraints**: `ungated` and `gated-permissive` MUST NOT weaken 007's host-isolation guarantee
(`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`/`CODEX_HOME` + disposable `cwd`) — re-verified live under both vendors' native
full-autonomy mechanisms during the design session (design doc §4 item 5), not merely assumed to
still hold when a new CLI flag/JSON field is added. Deny Rule evaluation for `gated-permissive` MUST
reuse the same fail-safe-deny behavior `approval_bridge.rs` already has for a broken pending response
(spec FR-010) — no new failure-handling path, same function extended.
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user, one active model/session at a time (unchanged `ChatState`/
`ActiveSession` invariant). Two new enum-like concepts (`AutonomyMode`, a fixed, small
`DenyCategory` set — see Data Model for exactly which categories are actually evaluable per vendor),
no general-purpose rule engine.

### Vendor mechanism verified for `ungated` (2026-09-17 design session + this planning session)

- **Claude Code** (`claude.rs::build_command`, currently claude.rs:117-145): replace the hardcoded
  `.arg("--permission-mode").arg("default")` with `.arg("--permission-mode").arg("bypassPermissions")`
  and _omit_ `.arg("--mcp-config").arg(mcp_config)` / `.arg("--permission-prompt-tool").arg("mcp__holzi-approve__approve")`
  entirely for this mode — confirmed via `claude --help` (v2.1.274) that `bypassPermissions` is a
  valid `--permission-mode` enum value, and confirmed live (design doc §4 item 5) that host isolation
  holds under it.
- **Codex** (`codex.rs::spawn_codex_app_server`, `thread/start` call at codex.rs:299-316): the
  approval posture is **not a CLI flag** for the `app-server` transport 007 actually uses (unlike the
  standalone `codex`/`codex exec` CLI's `-a`/`-s` flags, which do not apply here) — it is the
  `approvalPolicy` field of the `thread/start` JSON-RPC params. Verified 2026-09-17 against the
  installed CLI's own schema (`codex app-server generate-json-schema`, `ThreadStartParams` under the
  `v2` schema set): `approvalPolicy` accepts `"untrusted" | "on-request" | "never"` (an `AskForApproval`
  enum), and a separate, currently-unset `sandbox` field accepts `"read-only" | "workspace-write" | "danger-full-access"`
  (a `SandboxMode` enum). `ungated` therefore sets `"approvalPolicy": "never"` **and** explicitly adds
  `"sandbox": "workspace-write"` to the existing params object — the second part is a genuinely new
  field 007 never sends today (it currently relies on Codex's own default), made explicit here so
  `ungated` never silently degrades to `danger-full-access` if that default ever changes upstream.
  (Codex also exposes an `approvalsReviewer: "auto_review"` option — an automatic reviewing subagent —
  considered and not used: it is Codex's own built-in equivalent of `gated-permissive`, but adopting
  it would mean trusting Codex's internal review model instead of holzi's own deny-rule list, which
  is exactly the "harness decides risk, holzi's rule is an explicit additional filter" split the spec
  clarification rejected reversing.)

### Vendor mechanism for `gated-permissive` — reuses 007 unchanged, only the decision changes

Both vendors keep **exactly** their `standard`-mode command construction (`--permission-mode default`
for Claude; `"approvalPolicy": "on-request"` for Codex) — per the spec clarification, "what needs
approval" stays the delegate's own judgment, unchanged. The only change is inside
`approval_bridge::request_approval` (approval_bridge.rs:25-68): when the invocation's `AutonomyMode`
is `gated-permissive`, skip the `permission::decide(mode, risk)` call entirely (that reads
`chat.permission_mode`, which does not apply to this mode per spec FR-004) and instead evaluate the
incoming `(tool_name, input)` against the persisted `cli_delegate.deny_rules` — `Allow` unless a
configured category matches, `Deny` if it does, with the existing `Ask`-path's oneshot/event
machinery simply never invoked for this mode (no human turn in this loop by design).

### Per-vendor Deny Rule evaluability (verified against real schemas this session — a real asymmetry, not assumed uniform)

| Category                                                              | Claude Code                                                                                                                               | Codex                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workspace-root escape (write/read outside the invocation's workspace) | Evaluable — file-editing tool `input` carries `file_path` directly                                                                        | Evaluable for `CommandExecutionRequestApprovalParams` (`command`, `cwd` fields present) but **not evaluable** for `FileChangeRequestApprovalParams` — that payload (verified via `FileChangeRequestApprovalParams.json` schema) carries no path at all, only `itemId`/`reason`/`threadId`/`turnId`/`grantRoot`. A Codex file-change deny rule cannot be enforced from the approval payload alone with today's schema. |
| Network access                                                        | Heuristic only — matched against `Bash`/`WebFetch` tool name and command text (Claude's approval payload has no structured network field) | Structured and reliable — `CommandExecutionRequestApprovalParams.networkApprovalContext` (`host`, `protocol`) is present precisely when the call is network-triggered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Credential/secret-path patterns (`.ssh`, `.aws`, `.env`, `id_rsa`, …) | Evaluable — same `file_path`/`command` text matching as workspace-root escape                                                             | Evaluable for `CommandExecutionRequestApprovalParams` (`command` text), **not evaluable** for `FileChangeRequestApprovalParams` for the same reason as workspace-root escape                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This Phase 1 design finding is resolved by FR-015: when an enabled `WorkspaceEscape` or
`CredentialPaths` rule is evaluated against a field-less Codex `FileChangeRequestApprovalParams`,
the action is denied fail-closed. The implementation does not request an upstream schema change or
drop either category; evaluable Claude and Codex command actions retain their normal matching logic.
T008 defines this behavior, with unit coverage in T011 and the Codex file-change regression in T029.

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

Evaluated against the holzi Constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, hard-pinned from
haex-hive, revision `336eaf1e`):

| I. No Secrets in Git                                    | ✓ PASS | No new secret-handling surface — Deny Rules are non-secret category identifiers in a preference row; delegate credentials are unchanged from 007.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| II. No Local Absolute Paths in Versioned Config         | ✓ PASS | Nothing new is versioned; workspace-root/deny-rule state is runtime preference data, not committed config.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| III. Project Identity Is Device-Independent             | ✓ PASS | `cli_delegate.deny_rules` is device-scoped exactly like `chat.permission_mode`, following the existing `PrefScope::Device` pattern — no new identity concept.                                                                                                                                                       |
| IV. Cross-Repo References Pin Immutable Revisions       | ✓ PASS | No new external harness content or dependency; `rmcp`'s existing pin is untouched.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| V. External Sources Are Opt-in Per Project              | ✓ PASS | N/A — no external harness content involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| VI. Self-Modifying Instructions Are Always Review-Gated | ✓ PASS | This feature's docs/spec edits land through normal PR review like any other change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| VII. Relay Unavailability Never Blocks Local Work       | ✓ PASS | Autonomy mode and deny-rule evaluation are local subprocess + local preference reads, independent of holzi's sync relay.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| VIII. No Concealment Instructions in Agent Output       | ✓ PASS | Spec FR-005 requires every gated-permissive turn to record every tool call and to make the active autonomy mode visible; `ungated` runs are explicitly documented (spec US2 scenario 2) as intentionally not producing a per-call record, which is disclosed to the user via the visible mode label, not concealed. |

**Result**: All gates PASS. No Complexity Tracking entry needed.

```

**Structure Decision**: One new backend file (`cli_delegate/autonomy.rs`) holds the two new enums and
the per-vendor deny-category matching logic in one place, since that logic is inherently
vendor-comparative (the asymmetry table above) and does not belong inside either `claude.rs` or
`codex.rs` alone. Every other backend change is a small, localized branch inside an existing function
(`build_command`, `thread/start` params, `request_approval`) — no parallel execution path, no new
top-level module, matching 007-cli-delegate's own precedent of staying additive at existing seams.
Frontend follows the same pattern: one new composer control (per-request, ephemeral) and one new
settings component (persistent deny rules), both modeled directly on an existing sibling component
rather than introducing a new UI pattern.
