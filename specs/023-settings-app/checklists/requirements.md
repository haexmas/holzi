# Specification Quality Checklist: Einstellungs-App mit Kategorien

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Both clarification markers are resolved (session 2026-09-26): the federation
  app is removed and its old routes lead to "Allgemein"; the "Föderation"
  category comes with a federation spec (US5, FR-006, FR-017). "Darstellung"
  holds only the color scheme; the background belongs to the desktop icons and
  grid spec (FR-015).
- The spec names the haex-vault reference by commit SHA only; the file paths in
  the input line are references, not requirements.
