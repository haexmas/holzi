# Specification Quality Checklist: Verschlüsselte Ordner in Speichern

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The spec names the haex-vault template (repository, full revision, path) and, under Assumptions,
  the cipher and block size it would carry over. That follows the house style of 038 and 044, which
  name their templates the same way; the requirements themselves stay at the level of behaviour
  (FR-015 asks for block-wise encryption with ranged reads, not for a cipher).
- Decisions from the operator (2026-10-10) are recorded under Clarifications; no open markers.
- Extensions reach an encrypted folder only through `remoteStorage` and a per-folder grant the user
  gives in holzi's own prompt, never through the manifest (FR-035 to FR-039, operator 2026-10-10);
  otherwise they keep seeing only their own area (038 FR-010).
- Assumed without asking: copying out of an encrypted folder into a plain folder of a storage asks
  first, onto the device it does not; orphaned content objects are removed after 24 hours.
