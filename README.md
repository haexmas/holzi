# holzi

A portable, isolated personal-agent app. Runs as a Tauri application on any device the operator owns (desktop, server, iOS, Android).

- All LLM credentials and model configuration live inside holzi. Opens on any host, works even if the host has no LLM installed.
- Nostr relay endpoint plus iroh peer in one process, forming a closed federation with the operator's other holzi installations.
- Exposes an MCP server for external clients. Standard MCP auth applies.
- Local-first, user-chosen models. No automatic model routing.
- Mobile participates as a full peer while foreground; unreachable while backgrounded is a normal presence state, not an error.

## Design

The design corpus lives under [docs/](docs/) and the numbered specs under [specs/](specs/). Founding architecture first, then v1 scope revisions on top of it.

- [plans/README.md](plans/README.md) — advisory roadmap for the first desktop MVP; the numbered specs remain normative.
- [docs/design/founding.md](docs/design/founding.md) — founding architecture. Partially superseded by the v1 scope document below (see its front matter for the pointers).
- [docs/plans/2026-09-04-v1-scope-design.md](docs/plans/2026-09-04-v1-scope-design.md) — draws the v1 line and revises identity/pairing, storage, and mobile. Normative for v1 where it differs from founding.
- [docs/plans/2026-09-04-haex-crdt-extraction-plan.md](docs/plans/2026-09-04-haex-crdt-extraction-plan.md) — extraction of the SQLite + CRDT-sync layer into the standalone `haex-crdt` crate (shipped as v0.1.0; holzi consumes it as a Rust dependency).
- [docs/plans/2026-09-07-cross-user-sharing-deferred-design.md](docs/plans/2026-09-07-cross-user-sharing-deferred-design.md) — deferred design for cross-user shared spaces. Not v1; captured so closed-federation work does not foreclose it.
- [specs/001-frontend-onboarding/](specs/001-frontend-onboarding/) — first numbered spec (Landing / Anlegen / Öffnen / Verbinden / Unlock).

## Status

Etappe 1 (App und Instanzlebenszyklus) merged 2026-09-09. Etappe 2 (Anbieter und Modellkatalog) und Etappe 3 (Nutzbarer Chat) in Arbeit. Identity model settled on per-instance keys stored inside the encrypted SQLite (no federation-root, no paper-seed). External `haex-crdt` crate provides the SQLite + CRDT-sync foundation.

## Building holzi

holzi is a Tauri 2 app: a Nuxt frontend and a Rust backend. CI builds and
tests it on Ubuntu 24.04 (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). The other systems
below follow the upstream requirements of Tauri and of holzi's native
dependencies but are not built in CI.

### Requirements on every system

- **Rust** 1.95 or newer through [rustup](https://rustup.rs) (`rust-version`
  in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`; CI uses the current stable).
- **Node.js** `^22.19.0`, `^24.11.0` or `>=26` and **pnpm** 9.15 through
  Corepack: `corepack enable`.
- Native build tools for these crates, all compiled from source during the
  Rust build:
  - SQLCipher with a vendored OpenSSL (`rusqlite` from `haex-crdt`) needs a C
    compiler, **Perl**, **make** and **libclang** (its bindings are generated
    with bindgen).
  - `aws-lc-sys` (rustls) and the tokenizers of the local models
    (`onig_sys`, `esaxx-rs`) need a C/C++ compiler.

### Linux

**Debian / Ubuntu** (what CI installs):

```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential curl wget file \
  libxdo-dev libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev \
  libasound2-dev libclang-dev
```

**Arch**:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed webkit2gtk-4.1 base-devel curl wget file openssl \
  appmenu-gtk-module libappindicator-gtk3 librsvg xdotool alsa-lib clang perl
```

**Fedora**:

```bash
sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1-devel openssl-devel curl wget file \
  libappindicator-gtk3-devel librsvg2-devel libxdo-devel alsa-lib-devel \
  clang-devel perl-FindBin perl-IPC-Cmd
sudo dnf group install "c-development"
```

`libasound`/`alsa-lib` is for microphone input (the default `voice` feature).

Build with the host's toolchain, outside any Nix shell. Alternatively, the
repository's Nix devShell (`nix develop`, or `direnv` via `.envrc`) provides
the toolchain. WebKitGTK still comes from the host, and
`scripts/with-nix-host-bridge.sh` points the build at it. The script assumes
Arch paths (`/usr/lib/pkgconfig`, `/usr/lib/gbm`), so on other distributions
build without the devShell.

### macOS

- Xcode, or the Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`. They
  bring the C compiler, make and Perl.
- If bindgen cannot find libclang: `brew install llvm`, then set
  `LIBCLANG_PATH` to its `lib` directory (`$(brew --prefix llvm)/lib`).

### Windows

- [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
  with the "Desktop development with C++" workload, and the MSVC Rust
  toolchain (rustup's default on Windows).
- WebView2 Runtime: part of Windows 10 (1803+) and 11. Otherwise install the
  Evergreen Bootstrapper.
- LLVM for libclang: `winget install LLVM.LLVM`, then set `LIBCLANG_PATH` to
  its `bin` directory (for example `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin`).
- [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/) for the OpenSSL build.
  [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) is optional; without it OpenSSL builds without
  assembly routines.

### Build and run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev      # development build with hot reload
pnpm tauri:build    # release bundle
```

On Windows run `pnpm tauri dev` and `pnpm tauri build` instead. The
`tauri:*` scripts go through a Bash wrapper (`scripts/with-nix-host-bridge.sh`)
that only matters inside the Linux Nix devShell.

The first Rust build compiles the local-inference stack (mistralrs, candle)
and takes several minutes. GPU builds: `pnpm tauri:dev:cuda` (NVIDIA, CUDA
toolkit ≥ 12 with `nvcc`) and `pnpm tauri:dev:metal` (Apple). See
[Local inference build](#local-inference-build).

### End-to-end tests

The end-to-end suite runs on Linux only. It drives the app through
`tauri-driver` and WebKit's WebDriver on a virtual screen. Other platforms
are planned in [scripts/e2e/PLATFORMS.md](scripts/e2e/PLATFORMS.md).

```bash
sudo apt install webkit2gtk-driver xvfb    # Debian / Ubuntu
cargo install tauri-driver --locked --version 2.0.6
pnpm test:e2e
```

`WebKitWebDriver` must be the same version as the host's WebKitGTK. The
suite checks this before it starts.

## Development setup

The repository uses the Claude speckit integration. After a fresh clone,
restore the ignored local `/speckit.*` entrypoints with:

```bash
specify init --here --ai claude --offline
```

### Local inference build

When using the Linux Nix devShell, run Rust/Tauri commands through
`scripts/with-nix-host-bridge.sh`. WebKitGTK 4.1 is intentionally provided by
the host system because its helper binaries must match the host runtime; the
host development package (for example `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` on Debian/
Ubuntu) must be installed. Outside the Nix devShell, the wrapper is a no-op.

The default `cargo build` enables the `llm-cpu` feature, which pulls
`mistralrs = 0.8.1` and its candle/tokio dependency tree. The first
build downloads and compiles many crates; expect several minutes on a
cold cache. Iterating on non-LLM code can skip that path with
`cargo build --no-default-features` (the `llm` module then compiles as
an empty gate).

For GPU inference, opt into one of the stacked features:

```bash
# NVIDIA GPU — requires nvcc + CUDA toolkit >= 12.0 at build time.
# The driver alone is not enough (Etappe 0 finding #3).
cargo build --features llm-cuda

# Apple GPU.
cargo build --features llm-metal
```

**First-load warning on CUDA hosts.** Under CUDA the very first model
load per host takes 30-45 s while nvcc's JIT cache in
`~/.nv/ComputeCache` warms. Subsequent loads on the same hardware are
~4 s. The chat UI shows a dedicated "GPU wird für dieses Modell
optimiert" state for that first load (Etappe 0 finding #4).

### Running the local-inference integration test

The wrapper's real-runtime test is skipped by default because it needs
a GGUF file on disk. To exercise it, point `HOLZI_TEST_GGUF` at any
GGUF and add `--ignored`:

```bash
HOLZI_TEST_GGUF=~/path/to/model.gguf \
  cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml \
  --test local_inference -- --ignored
```

`HOLZI_TEST_GGUF_TOKENIZER` overrides the tokenizer repo id (default:
`Qwen/Qwen3-4B`).

### Local model presets

Holzi uses Qwen3 as its local model family: Qwen3-4B Q4_K_M is the desktop
preset, Qwen3-1.7B Q4_K_M is the smartphone preset, and Qwen3-0.6B Q4_K_M is
the low-memory fallback. See [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-local-model-profiles.md)
for the platform boundary and rationale.

### Running the real local CLI tool-loop test

The tool-loop suite contains one hardware/model-dependent acceptance test.
It loads the GGUF, verifies that the model requests `run_command`, approves
only the exact harmless fixture command, executes it through Holzi's real CLI
tool, and verifies that the output is included in the final model response:

```bash
HOLZI_TEST_GGUF=~/path/to/tool-capable-model.gguf \
  cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml \
  --test chat_tool_loop_permissions \
  a_real_local_model_can_request_and_process_a_cli_command \
  -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The model must support tool calling. The test is ignored by default so normal
developer test runs stay fast. CI runs the deterministic
`ci_e2e_loaded_model_can_request_and_process_a_cli_command` test in the
dedicated `local-cli-e2e` job; this keeps the CI gate independent of model
sampling and network-hosted weights. For CUDA, add `--features llm-cuda`
before `--test`.
