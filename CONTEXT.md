# holzi

Portable personal-agent Tauri app. One user, one operator, small set of
their own devices sharing an encrypted SQLite vault via CRDT sync.

## Language

### Identity model

**Vault**:
The encrypted SQLite database file (`*.db`) plus its schema. The unit
of ownership: one vault holds one operator's data.
_Avoid_: instance (used to mean this earlier, deprecated), database.

**Installation UUID**:
Per-app-installation identifier stored in a file at
`<AppLocalData>/installation-id`. The corresponding `installation_uuid` is
also recorded in the sync-tracked `known_devices` table, so a copied vault
can carry that historical row with it. The lookup key `HolziBootstrap` uses to
decide whether the current open is genesis, resume, or adoption of a copied
vault; adoption mints a fresh `vault_device_uuid` for the new installation.
_Avoid_: device id (ambiguous — see below).

**Vault Device UUID**:
Per-`(vault × installation)` identifier stored in `known_devices`. The
CRDT `device_id` for HLC timestamps and signatures on this replica.
Different on every device that has ever opened this vault, including a
device that opened a copy of the vault (the adoption path mints a new
one). Used as the FK target for per-device rows.
_Avoid_: device_id (unqualified — usually means this, but callers
sometimes mean installation_uuid).

**Vault Identity Keypair**:
Singleton `vault_identity` row containing the vault's secp256k1
keypair. Copies of the vault share the same keypair — this is the
identity the vault itself holds and moves with the file.

**Adoption**:
The `HolziBootstrap` path taken when a copied vault file is opened on
a device that has never seen it. Mints a fresh `vault_device_uuid`,
which automatically isolates the new device from the source device's
per-device rows.

### Scope conventions

**Per-vault data**:
Rows that apply to the whole vault across every device. Examples:
`providers`, `models`, `chat_threads`, `chat_messages`,
`vault_preferences` entries (see below). Sync-tracked, no
device-discriminator column.

**Per-device data**:
Rows that apply only to a specific device. Composite PK includes
`vault_device_uuid` with FK to `known_devices`. See ADR-0001.

**Vault Scope Sentinel**:
The nil UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` — reserved as a
row in `known_devices` representing "vault-wide" in tables that would
otherwise be device-scoped. See ADR-0001.

### Model catalog

**Catalog entry**:
One of the compiled-in GGUF suggestions under
`src-tauri/src/catalog/model_catalog.json`. Not installed until the
user downloads it.

**Installed model**:
A GGUF file physically present at
`<AppLocalData>/models/<slug>/<filename>` on the current device. The
filesystem is the authority for "installed on this device"; the
`models` table only carries catalog metadata (name, context window,
tokenizer repo, provider id).

**Provider**:
An entry in `providers`: `local` (mistralrs in-process), `api_key`
(external HTTP API such as Anthropic), or `cli_delegate` (spawn an
external CLI — design pass open).

**Model ID**:
Cross-provider unique string. For local models: catalog id. For api_key
models: `<provider_uuid>:<remote_model_id>` composite. Persisted verbatim
as `chat_messages.model_id`.

**Fit**:
Hardware verdict for a catalog entry — `Fits` / `Tight` / `TooBig` /
`Unknown`. See `hardware::fit`.

### Chat runtime

**Adapter**:
`ProviderAdapter` trait implementation. One per provider kind:
`LocalAdapter` wraps a loaded `LocalModel`; `AnthropicAdapter` wraps
the HTTP client. `ChatState` holds `Arc<dyn ProviderAdapter>`.

**Active Session**:
The currently-loaded model for chatting. In-memory in `ChatState`,
not persisted directly. Recovered on next launch via the session
resolver reading `preferences`.

**Session Resolver**:
The chain `last_active_model → default_model (device) → default_model
(vault) → first-available → onboarding` that decides which model
loads on chat-page mount. Only the terminal load runs — no
preference-write happens along this chain.

### Sprachkonventionen im UI

**Workspace / Arbeitsbereich**:
Same concept. "Arbeitsbereich" as German UI label (visible in
onboarding wizard, workspace-landing headers). "Workspace" in code,
folder names (`src/pages/workspace/`), and technical documentation.

**Standard-Modell / `default_model_id`**:
Same value. "Standard-Modell" as German UI label. `default_model_id`
as the preferences-key suffix and Rust/TypeScript identifier.

**Gerätename / `alias`**:
Same value. "Gerätename" as German UI label. `alias` as the
`known_devices` column and Rust/TypeScript identifier.

**Window Manager (`wm`) / App / Fenster (Window) / Tab / Launcher** (spec 015):
The in-app desktop concept, adopted from haex-vault. A **Workspace**
(Arbeitsbereich) contains **Windows** (Fenster); each Window contains
one or more **Tabs**, each Tab an instance of an **App** (Chat,
Einstellungen; Föderation was an App in spec 015 and is a settings category
since spec 023). The **Launcher** lists
available Apps and opens them as Windows. "Fenster" and "Tab" as
German UI labels; `wm` as the code prefix (`useWindowManagerStore`,
`src/lib/wm/`, `src/components/wm/`, action ids `wm.*`, Tauri commands
`wm_*`) and "window"/"tab"/"app" as identifiers (`WmWindow`, `WmTab`,
`AppDefinition`). Not to be confused with the OS-level application window
(singular, Tauri-managed); the window manager is an in-app desktop rendered
inside it. Specs 015 and 020 call it **Shell**; it was renamed on
2026-09-25 because "shell" also means the command line, which agents will
be granted or denied access to (spec 021). Do not use "shell" for this
concept in new code or specs.

**Dock / Leiste / Rad** (spec 045):
The control of the workspace that holds the **Steuer-Einträge** (Launcher, window overview,
workspace overview), the apps the user **pinned** (angeheftet) and every **running** app (laufend:
at least one instance in any workspace). It shows as a **Leiste** (bar) along an edge or as a
**Rad** (wheel), one button that fans the entries out. An **Instanz** of an app is one of its tabs,
alone in its own window or next to other tabs. The entries are the vault preference `dock.items`
(synced), style and position the device preference `dock.placement`; code lives in
`src/lib/wm/dock.ts`, `useDock`, `src/components/wm/Dock*.vue`.
_Avoid_: "Taskleiste" in UI text, "Action-Menü".

**Sitzung (wm session)** (spec 022):
Which workspaces, windows and tabs are open, with window geometry and state and
each tab's location and back/forward history. Saved (`wm_sessions_no_sync`, one
JSON row per device, never synced) only while the setting "Sitzung
wiederherstellen" (`wm.session_restore`, one value for the vault since spec 023,
off by default) applies; turning it off deletes the saved session. Not the **vault
session** (spec 013: unlock to lock, one process) and not the chat's **Active
Session** (the loaded model). Avoid "Layout" for this in user-facing text.

**Ort (Location) / Tab-Historie** (spec 020):
Where a Tab stands inside its App: an app-relative path plus query
(`/thread/<id>`, `/models?sort=size`), pure data (`TabLocation`). Each
Tab keeps its own linear back/forward **Tab-Historie** (`TabHistory`),
in memory only. "Ort" and "Verlauf" as German UI wording; never the
webview's browser history, which holzi does not use as navigation state.

**Aktion (Action) / Berechtigungsbereich (Scope) / Aufrufer (Caller)**
(spec 020):
Every state-changing control of the window manager and its Apps triggers a
catalog **Aktion** (`ActionDefinition`, `runAction`) with a JSON
schema, a target, a **Berechtigungsbereich** and an effect; the
**Aufrufer** is the user, the built-in agent or an external agent.
Actions in the `guardrails` scope are user-only.
_Avoid_: "command" for these — in holzi "command" means Tauri commands.

**Werkzeug (tool) / Wirkungsart / Risikostufe** (spec 032):
A **Werkzeug** is an **Aktion** offered to a model that holzi's own chat
drives, local or reached with an API key; the tool loop lists it with source
`action`. A chat turn starts with a fixed core of tools and the search
`find_actions`; the model finds the rest and gets it from the next step on. The
**Wirkungsart** of an action (`read`, `write`, `destructive`) maps to the
**Risikostufe** the approval mode decides on: `Safe`, `Change`, `Risky`.
Actions in the `guardrails` scope are never offered. Whether a model can call
tools at all is its capability `tool_use` (`ModelCapabilities`).
_Avoid_: "command" for tools — in holzi "command" means Tauri commands.

**Passwortmanager / Kopfdaten / Verlaufsstand** (spec 034):
The built-in secret store: the app `system.passwords` of the window manager
over the tables `haex_passwords_*` of the vault, synced like all vault data.
**Kopfdaten** (`ItemHeader`) are an entry without its secrets — title,
user name, address, tags, folder, markers for a TOTP or passkeys; lists and
the search hold nothing else. A **Verlaufsstand** (`SnapshotData`) is one
saved state of an entry; restoring one makes it current and adds a state of
its own, so no state is lost. Secrets sit unencrypted in the vault database
(ADR 0007); they stay in the backend until the user asks to see or copy one.
_Avoid_: "Version" for a Verlaufsstand, "Passwort" for an entry (an entry
holds a password, a TOTP secret, custom fields, attachments and passkeys).

**Aufrufer (`Caller`) / Freigabe (`Grant`) / Bereich (`Scope`)** (spec 034):
Every access to the password manager goes through one `PasswordsService` that
takes a **Caller** — the user, the built-in agent, an extension, an external
agent, or a holzi function (`Internal`) — fixed by the entrance, never by an
argument. A **Freigabe** gives a caller `Read` or `ReadWrite` for a **Bereich**:
all entries, or those with a tag. The user needs none. The built-in agent can
only search titles, tags and folder names; no action reads a secret.
_Avoid_: confusing the **Bereich** of a Freigabe with the
**Berechtigungsbereich** (`scope`) of an action (spec 020); they are different
things that happen to share the English word.

**Ablage / Kopier-Dialog** (spec 036):
The **Ablage** is the password manager's own list of entries and folders that
were cut or copied, waiting to be pasted: ids only, shared by all its windows,
emptied when the last one closes or the vault changes. It is not the system
clipboard; nothing of an entry reaches another program that way (copying a
user name or password to the system clipboard is a separate action). Pasting
a copy opens the **Kopier-Dialog**: title or suffix, "Verlauf übernehmen",
user name or password as a Verweis on the original, "Passkeys per Verweis".
_Avoid_: "Zwischenablage" for the Ablage.

**Verweis (Platzhalter) / Passkey-Verbindung** (spec 036):
A **Verweis** is a placeholder in a value — `{$<id>:username}`,
`{$<id>:password}` or `{$<id>:extra:<key>}` — that stands for that value of
another entry. It is stored as written and resolved only in Rust when the
value is read, up to 12 steps; a cycle is refused on save, and an unresolved
Verweis is an error, never an empty text. A Verweis grants no access: a
caller without the source in its Bereich gets nothing. A **Passkey-Verbindung**
shows a passkey of one entry at another entry without copying its key; it
goes with the passkey or either entry.
_Avoid_: "Link" for a Verweis in the UI (it reads "Verweis auf <Quelle>"),
"Kopie" for a Passkey-Verbindung.

**Tab Details / Extra / Verlauf** (spec 036):
The three tabs of an entry in the password manager: **Details** (title, user
name, password, address, TOTP, note), **Extra** (custom fields, attachments,
passkeys) and **Verlauf** (the timeline of its Verlaufsstände). The tab is
part of the **Ort**, so a Tab-Historie and a restored Sitzung come back to it.
_Avoid_: "Tab" for these alone when the window manager's tabs could be meant;
say "Tab des Eintrags".

**Einstellungskategorie (settings category) / Unteransicht** (spec 023):
A group in the settings' sidebar — Allgemein, Darstellung, Modelle, Agenten,
Föderation (`SETTINGS_CATEGORIES` in `src/lib/settings/registry.ts`). A
category with several areas starts with an overview that leads into
**Unteransichten**; every category and sub-view is an **Ort** of the settings
tab. Settings apply to the vault on every device; only the Gerätename, the
Standard-Modell, the Spracherkennungsmodell and the Dock-Position stay per
device (FR-024). A choice saves on selection, without a save button.

**Farbschema (color scheme)** (spec 023):
Hell, Dunkel or System (`appearance.color_scheme`, vault value, default
System); System follows the operating system. Applied as the `dark` class and
`color-scheme` on `<html>`. Pages before unlocking follow the operating system.
_Avoid_: "Theme" in user-facing text.

**Geräte der Vault (vault devices)** (spec 023):
The rows of `known_devices` except the Vault Scope Sentinel, shown in the
category "Föderation" (`list_vault_devices`, action `settings.devices.list`):
this device first and marked "Dieses Gerät", the others by Gerätename, unnamed
ones as "Unbenanntes Gerät". Other devices appear once the sync exists or in a
copied vault; "zuletzt online" waits for the sync spec.

**Darstellung (appearance) / Tönung / Farbfeld / Fensterhinweis** (spec 035):
**Darstellung** is the category and the set of all look settings of a vault: the
colour scheme (hell/dunkel/automatisch) and the appearance (`appearance.theme`,
one synced value for the whole vault). A **Farbfeld** (colour field) is one
choice in a row: a preset or a custom colour (`#rrggbb`). A **Tönung** (tint)
is the hue and capped chroma of a colour field applied to the default surfaces
of the current scheme (window, container, component, text); the accent is no
tint but a colour whose lightness is derived for readability ("angepasst"
tells the user when). The **Fensterhinweis** (window hint) draws the active
window's border in the accent colour. "Sitzung" and "Window Manager (wm)" keep
their meaning; the appearance is not part of a Sitzung.

### Sync zwischen eigenen Geräten (spec 024)

**Hauptgerät (main device)**:
A device of the vault that holds the private key of the vault identity. Only
main devices sign device lists, so only they add or remove devices. A vault can
have several; its first installation is one.

**Verknüpftes Gerät (linked device)**:
A device of the vault without the private key of the vault identity. It reads
and writes all vault data but cannot add or remove devices.

**Geräteliste (device list)**:
The device list signed with the vault identity: the current devices (device
key, role, name, network id) and the removed devices with their limit, under a
generation. The valid list is the one with the highest generation; on a tie the
one with the smallest hash. Devices accept each other only when both are on it.

**Ursprungsgerät (origin device)**:
The device that wrote a change. It is the node id in the change's HLC (its
`vault_device_uuid`) and stays the same when the change is passed on.
_Avoid_: author, sender (the sender of a change can be a third device).

**Fortschrittsstand (progress)**:
Per origin device, the highest HLC this device has fully applied. Two devices
compare their progress and pull what they are missing.

**Transaktionsgruppe (transaction group)**:
All changes that share one HLC, which is one `Database::write` transaction.
It is never split and never applied in part.

**Nostr-Relay / iroh-Relay / Sync-Server**:
Three different third parties: a Nostr-Relay carries presence messages and
link rendezvous, an iroh-Relay forwards encrypted connections between devices
that cannot reach each other directly, and the Sync-Server (spec 026) keeps a
mailbox for devices that are offline.
_Avoid_: "Relay" on its own.

### Erweiterungen (spec 017)

**Erweiterung / haextension**:
An app of a third party that runs inside holzi in a tab, from a signed bundle (`.xt`, ADR-0008)
that is vault data, so every own device has it. Identified by publisher key and name; its tables
carry the prefix `<publicKey>__<name>__`.
_Avoid_: plugin, add-on.

**Prüfstelle**:
The one place in holzi that takes every request of an extension, knows which extension sent it
(from its frame, never from the request), checks the permission and runs the host function
(`extensions::bridge::dispatch`, ADR-0004 direction B).
_Avoid_: gateway, proxy.

**Erweiterungsrahmen**:
The sandboxed iframe in which an extension runs in a tab, with the channel over which it talks to
holzi. holzi creates both, so it knows whose a frame is; a frame has no access to holzi's own
interface on any platform.
_Avoid_: webview (holzi has no native extension webviews).

**Berechtigung (vault-weit / Gerät)**:
The permission of an extension to run one kind of host function on a target, in the state
granted, denied or ask. A remembered one is vault data and holds **vault-wide** (all own devices)
or for **one device** (ADR-0001); only the shell holds on one device, every other kind on all,
and nobody chooses. A temporary one
lasts until the vault closes. Spec 034 calls the same thing "Freigabe".
_Avoid_: grant for the stored row (use it only for the password manager's `Grant`).

### Internationalisierung (i18n)

All user-visible text uses `@nuxtjs/i18n`. Backend commands and
events return structured data (enum values, IDs, parameters), never
localized strings. Locale files under `src/i18n/locales/de.json` and
`src/i18n/locales/en.json` — both languages MUST be maintained in lockstep
for every user-visible string introduced by a feature.
_Avoid_: hardcoded German strings in `.vue` files or in backend
event payloads.
